<h1>Chapter 2010-11-24 - 1</h1>
<p>“Why do you keep asking me about doors,” asked Sophie.</p>
<p>The tramp thought about what to tell her.  At no time
did she seem to be aware of the terrible creature that
she sometimes turned into.  Sometimes she said things
that sounded like she had once been in his world, but
she never hinted that she had travelled between worlds
or that anything was unusual here.  The tramp mulled it
over and decided that time was running out.</p>
<p>“Sophie,” he said, “I'm not from here.”</p>
<p>“Of course not!”</p>
<p>“I mean, I'm from a different world.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>The tramp thought about this for a moment. “Actually,
I'm not sure.  All I know was, I was someplace else
and then I was here.  And I've got to get back there.”</p>
<p>“Why? What do you have there?”</p>
<p>The tramp now had to think about this as well.  Who knew
these simple questions would be so hard to answer?</p>
<p>“I just do, that's all.  It's not safe for me here.  It's
not where I belong.  And Sophie… I don't think it's where
you belong, either.”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about? This my house!”</p>
<p>“Is it?  Sophie, do you know what a car is?”</p>
<p>“Well, sure, silly!”</p>
<p>“How about a cell phone?”</p>
<p>“Of course.  What a thing to ask?”</p>
<p>“Sophie, where are they?  Where are the televisions
and computers?  You know about these things, but they
don't exist here!”</p>
<p>“Of course they do.  If I wanted a computer, I'm sure
there's one in one of these rooms.”</p>
<p>“Really?” said the tramp “Show me!”</p>
<p>So Sophie wandered down the hallway, counting the doors
until she thought she found the one she was looking for.
She opened it and looked inside.  Over her shoulder, the
tramp saw a small office with brightly painted walls and
fresh flowers in a vase.  On the white desk, there was
a an iMac, churning away with a colorful screensaver.  The
tramp also noted a cordless phone on the table and a laser
printer on a side table.</p>
<p>“Can you use it?” asked the tramp.</p>
<p>“If I wanted to,” said Sophie.  The tramp wanted to challenge
her, but he had to admit he didn't know enough about computers
to think up a test that would be convincing.  Come to think
of it, computers were kind of magic as far as he was concerned,
why wouldn't this world have one?</p>
<p>“Well, think, Sophie.  Where are all the people?”</p>
<p>“In the cities, of course.”</p>
<p>“Where are the cities?”</p>
<p>“I don't know.  Why would I know that?  I don't live
in the city.”</p>
<p>“What if you had to go to the city?  How would you get there?”</p>
<p>“Why would I need to go to the city?  The Whisperers bring me
anything I need.”</p>
<p>“What about friends? Don't you have any friends?”</p>
<p>“I have you and I have my husband.  And there's the bear sometimes,
but she's often in such a foul mood.  I don't much like talking to
her.  Why? Who are your friends? You've never mentined anyone.”</p>
<p>“Nevermind about my friends.  What about family?”</p>
<p>“I have my husband.”</p>
<p>“What about your mother and father?”</p>
<p>“Who?”</p>
<p>“Your mother and father.”</p>
<p>Sophie looked less certain now.</p>
<p>“You have a mother and father, don't you?”</p>
<p>“Of course, silly! Everyone has a mother and father!”</p>
<p>“What are their names?”</p>
<p>Sonja was silent.</p>
<p>“Don't you know their names?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Did they die?” The tramp was getting excited now, thinking he had found
a way to show her what was wrong with this world.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Do you have a brother or sister?”</p>
<p>“No,” said Sonja with certainty.</p>
<p>“But you don't know if you have a mother and father.”</p>
<p>“I said I do!” said Sonja with some heat.  She was getting very irritated
with the tramp now.</p>
<p>“But you don't remember their names.”</p>
<p>“<em>You</em> don't remember <em>your</em> name!”</p>
<p>“You don't know your husband's name, either.”</p>
<p>“I certainly do!”</p>
<p>“You said before that you didn't.”</p>
<p>“It's none of your business, whether I know my husband's name or not,
or my father's or my mothers.” Sonja grabbed the tramp by the arms.
“It's none of your business!  None!”  She shook him and her fingernails
sunk painfully into his skin. Then she coughed and her voice sounded like
a seal.  “Leave me alone!” she said and coughed again. “Leave me alone,”
but her fingernails sunk deeper into the tramp's shoulders and he couldn't
pull away from her.</p>
<p>“Sonja, you're hurting me.”</p>
<p>Sonja barked again.  Her eyes were glassy and silver, now.  Her teeth
small, sharp triangles.</p>
<p>“Sonja!”</p>
<p>She barked again and, when she opened her mouth, the tramp saw that she
had multiple rows of teeth in her mouth.</p>
<p>“Sonja! Let me go!”</p>
<p>She barked again and collapsed, pulling him on top of her.  She snapped
at him, but he managed to avoid her teeth.  She barked and blood spurted
from her mouth, spraying his face.  She was clinging to him and he was
trying to get away, but she was also thrashing about.</p>
<p>The tramp torqued himself out of her grasp.  He backed into the corner
of the room and looked at her in horror.  She was writhing on the floor
as if her legs wouldn't work.  She was trying simultaneously to crawl
on her hands toward him and to rip her shirt off.  Each time she barked,
she seemed less able to control her movements and more focused on getting
her blouse off.</p>
<p>The tramp at last realized that she couldn't breathe.  He thought of the
stream that ran through the ballroom.  He approached her and she scratched
at him.  He danced out of her striking range and stood behind her.  He took
a deep breath and the bent down to hoist her up by the arms.  She twisted
her head to snap at him and she reached over her head and clawed at his 
neck and back.</p>
<p>The tramp lugged Sonja toward the door, but her legs seemed not to work.
He had to drag her along.  She was snapping and scratching the whole way.
Every inch down the hallway was filled with pain and terror, but the tramp
understood that it was filled with equal pain and terror for both of them.</p>
<p>When they were half-way down the hallway, he noticed that she wasn't 
scratching him as hard.  The fight was going out of her.  She was more
dead weight.  With less fighting, he was able to make faster progress
and soon he was in the ballroom at the stream.</p>
<p>She gave one more thrash and twisted from his arms.  She fell to the ground
and her pants split open.  Somehow, within the two ripped legs of her
slacks there was one thick, silver tail.</p>
<p>She was oblivious to him now, crawling on her hands toward the stream.
He put his hands under her armpits and tried to help her slide into the
water.  At last, she got her head under the water and then in a flash she
slid into the steam.<br />
</p>
<p>The tramp fell on his butt and scooted away from the stream.</p>
<p>After a moment, something broke the surface of the swift-flowing water.
It took force of will to prevent the tramp from fleeing at the sudden
movement.  When he looked, he saw that it was the top of Sonja's head.</p>
<p>He approached carefully.  He could only see her forehead and eyes, but
they seemed to be human eyes again.</p>
