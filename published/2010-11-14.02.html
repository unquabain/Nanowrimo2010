<h1>Chapter 2010-11-14 - 2</h1>
<p>Cold had been looking up at the stairwell to the third floor for some times, letting the cold
sink into his bones.  He could hear footsteps up there and was trying to decide if he heard
one or two people.</p>
<p>After a while, he realized that he was being silly.  It didn't matter if there were one or
two people, he needed to go up there and deal with it.  If he didn't know the number, he
should simply expect the largest number possible.  There were only a few people Cold had
ever met in his life that he could not take two of at a time in a fight, if it came to that.</p>
<p>No, what Cold was really hesitating about was putting a foot on that creeky step and hearing
that voice that, much as he tried to convince himself was a product of his imagination, was
his sister's calling his name.</p>
<p>Silly, silly, silly.  Cold was not a silly man. Cold was a practical man, a solid man, a 
dogged, persistent man.</p>
<p>He placed his foot on the step, but did not put any weight on it yet.  An electric chill ran up his
spine.  He could hear the sound in his head: his sister's voice saying “Cold.”  He could hear it as
clearly as if the noise were actually in the air.  It terrified him.  Cold did not believe in ghosts,
and, further, had refused to believe that his sister could be dead.  She had run away.  That is what
Cold had believed since he was a boy.  She had run away for reasons he would never know.  It was a
choice she had made and there was nothing that a younger brother could have done, should have done
to stop it.  Any other scenario was…</p>
<p>…unthinkable.</p>
<p>He tensed his muscles and prepared to shift his weight.  Cold turned his thoughts to more practical
matters.  He could still hear shuffling footsteps on the floor above him, so his quary had not, to
his amazing luck, been aware of his presense.  That would surely change as soon as he started up
the noisy stairwell.  If he were going to surprise them and have any advantage, he would have to
run up the stairwell as fast as he could.  Once that chilling noise was made, he was committed.</p>
<p>He tensed, ready to burst forth at full speed.  On the count of three.</p>
<p>One…</p>
<p>Two…</p>
<p>Suddenly, Cold's cell phone burst forth loudly with a cheery, electronic tune.  The noise and the vibration
on his belt were like a starter's pistol.  Cold bounded up the stairs two at a time and burst into the attic
in a flurry of dust and noise, and his speed carried him into the air so that he landed with an heroic thud
on the old floor-boards, gun drawn and raised.  He spun around, scanning the attic for the tramp and whomever
he was meeting.</p>
<p>The attic was empty.</p>
<p>As his cell phone continue to sing merrily away in his belt, Cold pulled out his enormous flashlight and
scanned the floors in the gloom.  There were no footprints in the dust, only his own from the first time
he had come here, leading to the window.</p>
<p>He was alone in the attic.</p>
<p>Cold sighed a sigh that rumbled louder than usual and the receding storm clouds answered from beyond the hills.
He pulled out his phone and flipped it open.</p>
<p>“Cold,” he said, and in this empty space it echoed back to him with a hint of that sound from the stairs.</p>
<p>“A feather,” said the voice on the phone, and Cold had some mental work to do to trace back the voice to 
a face and a name.</p>
<p>“Jerry?”</p>
<p>“The marks were made by a feather.  The puncture marks, I mean.  I found a fiber in there, and the teacher
could tell under the microscope that it was from a feather.  <em>Corvus corax principalis.</em>”</p>
<p>“A crow?”</p>
<p>“A raven.  The fiber was found in the wound, so it was on whatever made it.  I think the feather itself made
the mark.”</p>
<p>“Their necks were punctured by a feather?”</p>
<p>“A quill.  I'm working on some other foreign tissue I found in the wound, but I think they were stabbed with a 
sharpened quill.”</p>
<p>“Like a pen?”</p>
<p>“Yeah!”</p>
<p>“Okay.  Okay.  So Mr. Scroter is working out?”</p>
<p>“Oh yeah!  We're like a team!  It's just like CSI, here.  You should see us work together in action!”</p>
<p>“That's great.  Keep at it,” said Cold and shut off the phone.  Had he just lied?  It wasn't great.  It didn't make
any sense.  It didn't help him in the least to know that they were stabbed in the neck with a feather.  It didn't kill
them.</p>
<p>On the other hand, maybe that was a good thing.  Maybe it was better that it didn't make any sense.  That meant it was
part of the piece of this that he hadn't figured out yet, which meant that he was closer to figuring it out.</p>
<p>Sure didn't feel that way, though.</p>
<p>Cold shivered.  It was as chilly up here as he remembered.  He glanced at the window, but had no desire to approach it.</p>
<p>Instead, he eyed an armoire placed against the far wall.  He hadn't looked in it when he was here before, didn't see the need.
Now, however, when people were vanishing, any place to hide was worth investigating.</p>
<p>Cold walked toward the large cabinet, noticing as he did so how dark and deep his footsteps appeared in the dust.  The floor
boards creaked ominously under his feet as he walked.  Some of them sagged distressingly when he stepped on them.  When he
got to the armoire, he saw that one of its doors was slightly ajar.</p>
<p>Cold glanced back at his bright, clear footprints leading from the stairwell across the empty attic to where he was standing.
His mustache bristled and he drew his gun again.  He exchanged his large flashlight with a smaller one and pressed that against
the top of his pistol, simultaneously steadying the weapon and illuminating what was in front of it.</p>
<p>He looked at the door of the cabinet for a moment before realizing that his two-handed hold on his gun and flashlight meant
he was out of hands to open the door.</p>
<p>He thought about it for a moment and contemplated using his foot, but the creaking in the floor made him hesitant to put all of
his weight on one foot.  So he forced upon himself a little reality check and put away his gun.</p>
<p>He opened the cabinet.  It was empty.  He examined the seams on the back of the cabinet, looking for perhaps some sort of secret
door.  Seemed to be an ordinary cabinet.</p>
<p>He opened the drawers, empty.</p>
<p>Checked the back of the doors for, whatever.  Nothing.</p>
<p>Cold sighed and closed the doors again.</p>
<p>He pushed his mustached over onto one cheek as he thought about the footsteps he had heard.  He had been trying to analyze them
for a while.  Was it possible that he had completely mistaken them?  The wind was blowing the shutters of the window at the far
end of the attic back and forth with a creak.  Perhaps the vibration in the screws had transmitted through the wood and sounded
like creeking footsteps on the floor below.  Was that at all likely?  Even possible?</p>
<p>Cold sighed a sigh that rumbled and turned to leave.  And that's when he saw the object lying on the floor.  It was lying directly
between two of his dark footprints in the dust-pale attic.  He walked to it and picked it up.  It was a charm bracelet.  The kind
teenage girls exchange with oaths of undying loyalty before they sleep with one another's boyfriends.  It might have belonged to
Harper.</p>
<p>Odd that he hadn't noticed it before.  Odd that he had examined the floor thoroughly for footprints or any sign of anything unusual
when the lack of any ususual sign was itself exceedingly unsusual and had stepped right over this bracelet without seeing it.</p>
<p>Cold sighed again and the distant clouds rumbled for him.</p>
