<h1>Chapter 2010-11-11 - 3</h1>
<p>The house looked different to Sonja, although she couldn't place her finger on just why.
That was familiar to her now, and it was irritating.  There were the hallways, but they
were a little more… solid.  The bookshelves had the same number of books, but seemed
fuller.  The books themselves seemed more interesting.  There was breakfast, and it was
piled as high, but it smelled more inviting.  Everything seemed to be one level more
wonderful today.</p>
<p>And that troubled Sonja.  It bothered her that there was so much she didn't understand.
It irritated her that there was so much around her that she didn't have words to
describe or even senses to fully perceive.</p>
<p>She prepared herself a plate of meat and pastry for breakfast.  She poured herself a
cup of juice and one of coffee.  The food was satisfying on her tongue, between her
teeth, sliding down her throat.  It felt nourishing.  Damn it.</p>
<p>She tried the coffee.  Oh! The coffee!  There it was again.  Stronger than before.
Stronger perhaps than the first time.  That shadow of a face to go with the smell,
the taste.  That… other man.  Not the man she had been with the night before, someone
else.  There were arms to go with that face, arms that could hold her and rock her.
There was a neck under that shadow in her mind into which she could bury her face.</p>
<p>Her husband was wonderful.  Her husband made her feel safe.  Her husband made her
feel loved.  And last night, her husband and made her feel… well… she suspected that
he might be some sort of God and he had made her his Goddess.  That was a silly thought,
but how else to describe this heaven?  At any rate, that was how she had felt in his
arms in the night past and she could write a silly love poem later about it if she
wished, but there it was.</p>
<p>But that shadow in her mind wouldn't go away.  It tarnished the silver and dimmed the
gleaming chandeliers.</p>
<p>At midday, she went walking but kept clear of the forest.  The grapes were ripe on the
vine and ready for harvest.  When she grew hungry, she found a lunch basket prepared
for her.  Bread, cheese, wine and grapes she could pluck right from the vine.  The
grapes were sweet, the cheese savory, the wine sour and sweet and…</p>
<p>And she stopped breathing.</p>
<p>The wine was poisoned with memory.  It caught in her throat and turned the air in her
lungs to smoke.  She fell to the ground and rolled in the dust, which flew into her
nose and burned there.</p>
<p>The attack had never come
on her so fast before. She was nowhere near the castle with its sustaining stream.
She could see it there at the top of the hill in the bright sunlight.  So far, so
high up that steep hill.</p>
<p>The other stream was closer, the border between her vinyards and the wild forest
with its murderous bear.</p>
<p>She barked twice and rose to her knees.  She barked again and blood sprayed the dust
and her hands.</p>
<p><em>Well,</em> she thought, <em>if it is death to go and death to stay, I'll die in the cold
water.</em></p>
<p>She walked on her knees toward the stream, then she got onto her hands and knees
and crawled, stumbling and rolling down the steep hill, barking and coughing.  Blood
covered her hands and coated her chin like a beard.</p>
<p>When she got to the bottom of the hill, the bear was waiting.  She stood there on
the far side of the stream waiting for Sonja.  Sonja stood on her knees and watched
the bear closely, but she didn't move.  The bear just watched her closely, breathing
slowly.  Sonja took a step toward the stream and the bear, and the bear didn't move.</p>
<p>Sonja turned and kneed her way upstream a little way.  The bear turned and ambled
that way too, staying opposite Sonja across the stream.</p>
<p>Sonja barked again and more blood erupted from her throat.  She felt dizzy along
with everything else.  She reached round her back and pulled on the cord that held
her dress together and the dusty, ripped cloth fell from her shoulders.  She slowly
and unsteadily got to her feet and stepped out of her clothes.  She stood there
naked in front of the bear and the bear didn't move.</p>
<p>She took a step forward, toward the stream.  Then another.  Then she was standing at
the edge of the stream, surely within the bear's striking range.</p>
<p>The bear moved.  She came forward and put her nose between Sonja's breasts and sniffed.
Then under Sonja's armpits.  Sonja barked up more blood onto the bear's head, but the
bear didn't seem to notice.  Then the bear put its nose between Sonja's legs.  Then the
bear pulled her head back across the stream to her side and watched Sonja again.</p>
<p>Sonja was trembling. Her lungs were burning and she could no longer see clearly.  She
dove into the stream.</p>
<p>The always seemed to be deeper and wider on the inside than it seemed from the outside.
She submerged herself completely in the water, letting the numbing cold surround her like a blanket.</p>
<p>Above her, the shadow of the bear.</p>
