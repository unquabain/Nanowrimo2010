<h1>Chapter 2010-11-06 - 2</h1>
<p>Sometime in the night, someone joined Sonja in the bed.</p>
<p>As tired as she had been hungry and then thirsty, she didn't move or
wake or open her eyes to see who it was. She only recognized that
someone warm and musty was depressing the soft bed next to her and
breathing softly. They didn't touch her, didn't speak, didn't move
other than the soft breathing of someone sleeping peacefully. There
was something comforting about the slow, regular rhythm; about the
warmth; about the musty smell of this presence. Something powerful and
protecting. So Sonja drifted further into comfortable, deep sleep.</p>
<hr />
<p>The next morning, there was no evidence of a bed-mate in the big,
comfortable bed. Sonja got out of it and found a robe waiting for her
hanging from one of the heavy oak posts.</p>
<p>She was hungry, not famished as before, but she wanted breakfast, so she
started wandering, looking for the dining stone that she had found the
day before. She opened the door to the room and stepped out into the
hallway. Something looked different about the paintings on the wall and
the bookshelves lining the walls of the rooms she passed through, but
she couldn't describe exactly what it might be.</p>
<p>By the time she found the long, wooden dining table she had eaten at
before, it had ceased to bother her. The whispers had begun to follow
her and lead her, and when she found the dining hall, they filled the
space from the handsome sideboard to the marvelous crystal chandelier
that cast such sparkling, brilliant light around the room.</p>
<p>The table was laden with food. Fruit, rolls, sausages, eggs, bacon,
juices, coffee... everything she might have wished for for breakfast was
here, was piping hot or ice cold as was appropriate, and was in such
marvelous, ridiculous abundance that she laughed aloud. The whispering
voices that surrounded her seemed also to laugh. She helped herself with
perfect boldness to a plate of breakfast and then to another.</p>
<p>She poured hot, black coffee into a dainty ceramic cup and held it in
front of her nose. The smell was filling, comforting, nutty, savory. It
reminded her of something... someone. Someone distant and masculine. She
took a sip of the coffee and realized she had never drunk black coffee
before. Someone else had. Who? She thought of the presence in her bed
the previous night and wondered if somehow the smell and heat of the
coffee reminded her of that man, whomever he was. Surely that must be
it.</p>
<p>Surely.</p>
<p>After she had finished the coffee, she returned to her bedroom and
looked through the great armoir. There she found an assortment of gowns
that fit her perfectly. She put one one and looked at herself in the
mirror. Whisper voices came in and brushed her hair from her face. They
produced ribbons and tied back her hair. They helped her tie up the back
of the gown she had chosen. She powdered her face and put on makeup.</p>
<p>After she was dressed, she went in search of the Grand Ballroom with
the stream running through it. When she found it, it was exactly as she
remembered it, with its polished parkay floor and chandeliers and rich
tapestries lining the walls. There was the rocky stream running through
the center, too. Just as she remembered it.</p>
<p>She took off the gold slippers she was wearing and dipped her toes into
the stream. The coldness was a shock, and it struck her all at once how
odd it was to have a stream running through such a marvelous ballroom.
Surely the dancers would fall into it as they circled one another.</p>
<p>She found her way from there to the main entrance. The heavy oak doors
opened for her to allow her into the cold, bright morning. There was a
courtyard with a fountain and a garden. There was a gate closed with an
iron portcullis. When she approached, it raised itself for her and she
stepped out.</p>
<p>What she saw took her breath away. Before her lay a valley partially
shrouded still in an evenescing morning mist. She was at the top of a
high hill overlooking the valley and the countryside beyond. There were
vinyards all the way down the hill to the valley, and a thick forest
on the far side. In the distance, just on the horizon, she caught the
glimmer of water: the ocean she had crossed in her little boat those
many years ago before she had come home to her palace.</p>
<p>Turning around, she saw, indeed, what a palace it was! It had everything
a fairy castle needed, tall turrets, waving penants, bridges, butresses,
widows walks... everything!</p>
<p>She started running down the road that wound through the vinyards.
As she ran, the last of the morning mist evaporated.  The air warmed
and the sun rose.  By the time she came to the bottom of the valley,
it was already lunch time.  She plucked a great bunch of purple grapes
from a vine. She put one in her mouth and it popped on her tongue with
such sweet juice that she had to close her eyes in order to taste it
all.</p>
<p>Someone seemed to whisper in her ear and when she looked to see who
it was, she saw a little basket under one of the vines.  She opened
it to find a half loaf of bread, a chunk of cheese, a wine glass
and a dusty bottle of wine.  The label of the bottle was written
in a strange script she could not read.  She took the basket and her
bunch of grapes to the edge of the stream that ran through the bottom
of the valley.  She found a mossy rock in the shade and began to lunch.</p>
<p>She opened the wine and, as she poured it into the glass, it occurred
to her that here was something else she had never tasted before, though
she had always been curious.  She sniffed it cautiously.  At first, it
smelled sweet-and-sour, like rotten fruit.  But there was spice, too.
So she took a sip.  The wine was strong and seemed to suck the moisture
from her cheeks.  At the same time, however, it filled her nose with 
the scent of plums and peaches, chocolate and cherries.  It even reminded
her a little of the coffee from that morning.  It overwhelmed her and
made her eyes water a little.</p>
<p>She had a few grapes and a bit of cheese, then attempted the wine again.
This time, the wine was no less intense, but it tasted of honeysuckle
blossoms and apricots as well as walnuts and almonds. It reminded her
less of coffee this time as of something else... or someone else. Once
again, the shadow of a person was just at the edge of her mind, stirring
just out of site.  This time, however, there was no mistaking it for the
mysterious sleeper from the night before.  This was someone female.
Thinking about this person made Sonja's chest ache as if with cold emptiness.
Something was missing from all of this.  How anything could be missing
from a world where anything she desired appeared before her almost before
she recognized that she desired it, Sonja could not begin to fathom.  But
there was an ache at the center of things that wouldn't go away and wouldn't
let itself be identified.</p>
<p>Sonja carefully poured the rest of her wine into the bottle and forced the cork
back in.  She wrapped the remaining cheese and bread in a napkin she found
in the basket and tied the bundle to the sash of her gown.  Then she crossed
the stream at a shallow point and went into the forest.</p>
