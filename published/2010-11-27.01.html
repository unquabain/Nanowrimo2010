<h1>Chapter 2010-11-27 - 1</h1>
<p>The orphan of darkness and Sonja sat on the top of the hill and watched the
sun go down.  The tramp played her songs on the guitar about good times and
happy people.  He had to rack his brain, for such songs are fairly few and
far between.  At least, the tramp didn't have many in his repertoire.  Mostly
he dredged up songs about songs and how great some particular genre of music
is.  Sonja requested him to repeat “Cha-Cha-Cha D'amour.”</p>
<p>Eventually, the sky turned pink and the clouds seemed to gather around the
sun in the West.</p>
<p>When the sun was low enough that they could look at it, Sonja took the tramps
hand and asked him “What will happen?”</p>
<p>“We'll go home.”</p>
<p>“What if it goes wrong? What if I get lost?”</p>
<p>“I'll find you.”</p>
<p>“What if you can't? What if I… what if I hurt you again?”</p>
<p>The tramp was idly plucking chords on his guitar, and he started to sing a
sentimental song he had learned once almost by accident.</p>
<p>“If tomorrow's sun doesn't shine.<br />
If no creatures stir in the morning time.<br />
If the clouds go still in the sky<br />
And the days roll in and pass us by<br />
I will ride your elevator<br />
We'll stay out until it is later<br />
If tomorrow's sun doesn't shine,<br />
At least I'll have my Clementine.”</p>
<p>He continued the song until the sun was gone.  Then Sonja put her head on
his shoulder and he played wordless chords until the dark blanket of night was pulled over
the blue twilight at last, and the stars became too many to count.</p>
<p>At last, he stopped and let his guitar fall silent.  It was time to go.  He stood up and helped
Sonja to her feet.  They turned and looked at the rock.  They stood side by side, looking at the
faintly glowing mouth in the rock.</p>
<p>“Are you ready?” asked the Tramp.</p>
<p>“No,” said Sonja, “Let's go.”</p>
<p>The tramp took a step ahead of her and brought up his guitar.  Sonja placed a hand on his shoulder
and together they stepped into the cave.</p>
<p>It was narrow, as he had remembered it.  He thought that there would be no trouble about turning
around to look at Sonja: he could barely turn his head.  In fact, the problem might be that he was
meant to be playing to the rocks, but he couldn't hold his guitar properly.  He held the instrument
vertically in front of him and plucked a chord.  Nothing happened.  He changed the chord and played.
The stone remained stone.</p>
<p>“Sing,” said Sonja.</p>
<p>The tramp had been singing all day and couldn't think of a song that felt appropriate.  So he struck
a minor chord and sang the first words that came into his head:</p>
<p>“My Bonny lies over the ocean”</p>
<p>His voice trembled as he sang, and the strings of the black guitar rang out in the closed space.  They
seemed to reverberate against the cold, damp stone.  The as the tramp continued, it was almost as if
the space that was barely large enough to hold them had developed an echo.</p>
<p>“My Bonny lies over the sea”</p>
<p>The tramp found a small space between the rocks that admitted him one further step.  He stepped forward
and the echo intensified.</p>
<p>“My Bonny lies over the ocean”</p>
<p>The echo sounded like a chorus, now.  As if he were a band, and not a lone guitar player.  He found the
could take another step in the cramped cave and did.</p>
<p>“Please bring back my Bonny to me.”</p>
<p>The cave walls softened and became like leather curtains.  He pushed them aside and stepped forward.
It was more like walking down into a throat than before, but he continued forward, holding his instrument
awkwardly vertical in front of him.</p>
<p>“Bring back, bring back, bring back my Bonny to me.<br />
“Bring back, bring back, bring back my Bonny to me.”</p>
<p>It was as if the throat they were journeying along were singing along with his tune.  The tramp was ashamed
that he was leading what should be an epic journey, but all he could think of was a nursery song.</p>
<p>“Last night as I lay on my pillow,<br />
Last night as I lay on my bed,”</p>
<p>The tramp found that he could walk freely now, and hold the instrument in a more relaxed position.  His fingers,
which should have started to become tired after a day of playing, fell into the shapes of the song like water
falls into the shapes of the rocks over which it flows.</p>
<p>“Last night as I lay on my pillow,<br />
I dreamed that my Bonny was dead.”</p>
<p>Sonja gave a little cough behind him, and gripped his shoulder a little more tightly.</p>
<p>“Bring back, bring back bring back my Bonny to me, to me<br />
“Bring back, bring back bring back my Bonny to me”</p>
<p>The slight luminescence that had been on the walls of the cave near the mouth had passed, and now it was total
darkness.  As he continued, the tramp found that he was no longer touching the walls.  He saw now how easy it would
be to get lost in the blackness.</p>
<p>“Oh blow the winds over the ocean<br />
Oh blow he winds over the sea”</p>
<p>The tramp listened to the echo of his voice.  Sometimes it seemed to come from the right and he knew that he must
steer a little to the left.  Sometimes it seemed to come from the left and he knew that he had wandered too far
in that direction.</p>
<p>“Oh blow he winds over the ocean<br />
And bring back my Bonny to me.”</p>
<p>Sonja coughed again, and the tramp thought it sounded a little like a dog bark, or a seal's.  She gripped his shoulder
more tightly, a little uncomfortably.</p>
<p>“Bring back, bring back, bring back my Bonny to me,” sang the tramp, envisioning the toothed, fish-eyed creature following
him in the dark and willing soft-eyed Sonja back to that body.</p>
<p>“Bring back, bring back, bring back my Bonny to me,” it was so dark, the tramp could not tell if his eyes were opened or
closed unless he squeezed them tightly enough together to feel his muscles.  He walked in a sea of red swirls and bright
yellow stars, listening to the tramp to his right and the tramp to his left.</p>
<p>Sonja barked and dug her fingernails a little tighter into the tramp's shoulder.  He could hear her wheeze in the darkness
behind him.  She walked more closely to him, so that he could feel her breasts against his back and her breath on his
shoulder.</p>
<p>The problem, the tramp evalutated, was not telling whether or not someone was following behind him, but <em>who</em> that someone
following behind him was.  She was having trouble walking, as if her legs had stopped working correctly.  She was breathing
more heavily and leaned more heavily on his shoulder, clutching it with those sharp fingernails.</p>
<p>The tramp knew she suffered from asthma; she had often had trouble breathing on their walks through the vinyard. But each
time he had seen her transform, it came with an breathing attack.</p>
<p>The tramp's voice started to grow thin and waver.  The echoes seemed further away now, and the tunnel no less dark.</p>
