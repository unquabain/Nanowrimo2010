<h1>Chapter 2010-11-15 - 2</h1>
<p>The tramp woke up slowly. His head hurt, he was covered in sticky blood.
Leaves and grass were sticking to him and… oh god!… ants!</p>
<p>He rolled over to the stream and began to wash himself off. It was
twilight, now, and he could hardly see what he was doing. The water was
icy cold, and that woke him up. He splashed some on his face and his
head cleared.</p>
<p>His head cleared and he was suddenly afraid. There were monsters in
these woods. Bears and… worse. What was she? That was not how mermaids
behaved in the stories he had heard, and he had heard a lot of stories.</p>
<p>He got up and buttoned the few remaining buttons on his shirt. Where
to go now? He was hungry and felt weak. There was the house, but was
that her house? Did she live there? Or did she skulk about the woods at
night? Was she hiding behind a bush now, watching him with those…</p>
<p>…eyes. There was something about her eyes when she had looked him in
the face. They were clear, colorless, round. Like a fish's. But there
had been that expression in them. She was afraid. She was as afraid as
he was. That was plain. Perhaps she was in trouble.</p>
<p>But what would it gain him to try to help her. She might be in trouble,
sure, but he was definitely in trouble.</p>
<p>He glanced about him in the failing light. The wood was dark and opaque.
The vinyard, at least had good visibility all around. So he headed away
from the shadows into the lesser shadows.</p>
<p>It occurred to him that he might go back through the door of the house
to his world, such as it was. It also occurred to him that as soon as he
set foot on the porch, naked daemon fish women with liquid, silver eyes
would emerge from beneath the floorboards and devour him like hungry
piranha.</p>
<p>He walked slowly up the hill, not knowing what else to do. He began to
get dizzy as he walked, probably from loss of blood. Some of the wounds
were still bleeding, but he didn't have anything to staunch the wound
except the bloody, matted shirt he was already hugging about himself.
Outside of his narrowed vision, he continuously thought he saw furtive
shapes darting from shadow to shadow among the grape vines. Worse, he
could swear that he heard whispers. Every time he stopped to listen,
however, the whispers would stop and he would think that it was just
the sound of his tattered pant legs brushing together. But then when he
began to walk again, he would decide that they definitely sounded like
whispers, not like cloth. He could almost make out words.</p>
<p>It was dark by the time he got to the top of the hill.  Stars were out.
He had never seen so many and so bright!  But they were a mess.  He could
not recognize a single constellation.  Foreign stars.</p>
<p>Something even more troubling was missing, however.  The house was gone.
Instead, there was a rock protruding from the top of the hill and, near
a small cleft in the rock, was his guitar.</p>
<p>His vision swam with images of needle-toothed silver serpent women
slithering from the rock as he approached and picked up his instrument.
The taught strings hummed slightly as he lifted it.</p>
<p><em>Sssh!</em> he thought.  The wicked instrument was sounding an alarm!  He
grasped the strings to muffle it and started to back away from the
mouth in the rock.</p>
<p>Walking backwards from the rock, however, he began to notice its shape.
It was broad and flat, like a stout tower.  The tramp began to think
that it might be useful to be up high, away from the moving shadows
of the vinyard and the blanketing blackness of the forest.  From
atop that tower, surely he would be able to see all around the forest
and no one could sneak up on him.</p>
<p>So the tramp circled around to the opposite side of the rock from the
opening.  Then he approached the rock.  Nothing slithered out at him.
He found the rock craggy enough that he could scale it clumsily with
his guitar in one hand, held away from his body and the rock to avoid
hitting it and making a noise.</p>
<p>He almost had reached the top.  He stretched one hand over the top of
the rock and, with one final pull, he pulled himself over it and found
himself looking at both the young woman and the enormous bear!  A
sudden panic gripped his heart.  The woman was dressed in tattered patches
of moss and matted grass and she was wrapped up in the arms of the bear.
They were both asleep.</p>
<p>The tramp let go of the rock and slid down to the base amid a tumble of
dislodged gravel.  He ran off into the vinyard and walked, fleeing from
shadows and whispers, until the morning light.</p>
