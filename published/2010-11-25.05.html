<h1>Chapter 2010-11-25 - 5</h1>
<p>The flash of light woke the tramp up.  In his disorientation, he nearly fell out of his tree.
The flash was over by the time he was fully awake and secure of his balance, so he didn't see
what caused it, but it had come from the top of the hill.</p>
<p>Looking around, he didn't see the bear anywhere, so he carefully dropped down from the tree
and went to the stream.  If Sonja were out there, he didn't know what condition she would
be in or whether she would try to attack him.</p>
<p>After a while, he noticed a sound that answered his question for him.  It was crying.
He splashed across the stream and made his way up the hill toward the big rock.  Sonja
was there.  She was on top of the rock, stark naked and she was sobbing into her hands.
The tramp had on new clothes that Sonja had given him, but he still had his worn travelling
cloak from when he first arrived.  He climbed up the rock and put it around Sonja.  In the
dark, he couldn't see her face or her eyes to tell if they were human or piscine, but he
took a leap of faith and put his arm around her.</p>
<p>She continued to sob for a while and the tramp was silent.  After a time, though, she grew
calmer and lowered her hands from her face.</p>
<p>“He's gone,” she said.</p>
<p>“The bear?” asked the tramp.</p>
<p>Sonja hissed at him in an uncomfortably non-human way and clawed at a patch of moss. But she
did not attack him.</p>
<p>“You were wrong,” she said. “He didn't tell me anything.”</p>
<p>The tramp didn't know what to say.  He held Sonja and tried to keep her warm as they sat
on the rock under the stars.  Though she did not fall asleep, she did fall into a regular
sort of a breathing pattern, and the tramp detected a small wheeze in it.</p>
<p>When the morning came, the house did not return.  Sonja didn't seem surprised.  After some
coaxing, the tramp convinced her to climb down from the rock.  The vinyard was still there
and they had grapes for breakfast.  But there was no cheese and there was no coffee.  The
whisperers were gone.</p>
<p>It was the first cloudy day either of them remembered seeing since they arrived.  It was
still warm, but it was a little muggy.  Sonja coughed several times as they walked about,
but the tramp didn't see any fish eyes.</p>
<p>After a while, they just stopped walking.  They had nowhere to go.  They had been around
the hill several times.  The tramp had his guitar, but he didn't feel like singing. Neither
one felt like talking.  So they stood, shoulder to shoulder. The tramp facing up the hill,
Sonja facing the forest.</p>
<p>After a while, Sonja gripped the tramps shoulder and for a moment he thought she had 
transformed.  But when he turned to look at her, he saw that she was human and
frightened.  At the bottom of the hill, something was rustling the foliage.  In
a moment, the bear came out of the woods and stood at the stream.  Sonja held the
tramp's hand.  Then the bear crossed the stream.</p>
<p>Sonja barked like a seal once.</p>
<p>The bear lumbered up the hill to where they were standing and stood in front of them.
It didn't say anything.  It just regarded them with unreadable eyes.</p>
<p>After he had grown tired of the sound of his own knees knocking together, the tramp,
who lived and breathed for words, said “I… I thought you couldn't cross the stream.”</p>
<p>“<em>Couldn't?</em>” said the bear with sudden heat. “There is nothing I <em>cannot</em> do! I am
a god!”  Then, she paused and said more calmly, “I <em>did</em> not cross the stream because
this is my son's country.  He has left it now and gone back to the stars.”</p>
<p>Sonja fell to her knees and began to weep and wail, “Oh mother! Mother! I'm sorry!
I didn't mean to send him away.  I didn't want to.  Oh, mother, I'm so sorry. You
were right! You were right about me! Will you eat me now?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Sonja.  I will eat you now,” The bear opened her mouth wide and said—for she
had never used her mouth for talking—“come, child.  Put your head in my mouth and
I will pop it between my teeth as you pop these grapes my son has grown for you.”</p>
<p>Sonja leaned forward and dutifully extended her neck.</p>
<p>“Hey! Stop that!” yelled the tramp.</p>
<p>Neither Sonja nor the bear minded him, so he said “Hey!” again and he punched the
bear in its soft nose.</p>
<p>The bear shook its head and closed its jaw.</p>
<p>“You can't just eat her!”</p>
<p>“Smelly thing, if you tell me one more time what I cannot do, I will spill your
intestines in the dust with one flick of my claw.”</p>
<p>“I mean, it's not her fault. I made her do it. It was my idea after all.”</p>
<p>“I will eat you tomorrow when you fail to find the way back to your world,
I promised you that, remember?” said the bear calmly.</p>
<p>“And you can't break your promise.”</p>
<p>The bear roared and reared back on her hind legs.  She raised a massive paw
and brought it back for a fatal swing.  Instinctively, the tramp held up the black
guitar as a shield. As he swung it round, the strings hummed in the air.  His grip
on the neck was, by chance and by habit, an A minor chord.  The bear checked her
swing.</p>
<p>“I also promised to cut out your guts if you told me what I cannot do. I have twice
now promised to kill you.  Explain to me why I cannot break my promises.”</p>
<p>Remembering the effect his song had had on the bear before, the tramp settled the
guitar on his chest and began to sing.  He sang about a girl who was taken from her
parents to a strange and wonderful place, but who longed to see her family again.
He sang of her love for her mother and father, and also her love for her husband
and her love for the sea (where that came from, he didn't know, but he was on a
roll).  He sang a song of agony for a girl who had to lose everything she loved
simply because she loved them.  The chords found themselves, the words fell from
his lips, the guitar spun music around the three of them and built and tore down
and re-built the house on the hill around them.  His fingers slid over the strings
and Sonja could hear the Whisperers again.</p>
<p>When he was done, Sonja got back to her feet and the bear fell back onto her front
paws.  But she said “Very pretty. You sing such pretty pain.  But you did not do as
I commanded.  You sang about this fish, but you did not sing about why I should
not eat you now.”</p>
<p>“No,” said the tramp, “no, I guess I didn't.”</p>
<p>“Why did you sing me this song?”</p>
<p>“I suppose that it's because I want you to let Sonja go home. She misses it more than
I do. I wasn't really ever happy there, either.  I liked to pretend that I was, I even
called myself… I called myself ‘Jovius’ because I thought I was jovial. But I wasn't.
I don't want to die here, but if I do, well that's that.  But I really think that Sonja
should get to go home.”</p>
<p>“Clever Smelly Thing,” said the bear, “Clever or lucky, it is the same thing.  You know
that she needs a guide to get back to your world.”</p>
<p>“A who now?”</p>
<p>“You will take Sonja tonight, the last night I said you could live, to the rock at the top
of the hill.  That rock has a cleft and that cleft is the mouth of a tunnel back to your
world.”</p>
<p>“I've been in that cleft. It has no tunnel. It's closed at the back.”</p>
<p>“Silly Smelly Thing! I am a god and you have convinced me to put off slaying you for many
hours with your song! Surely such a stupid thing as a rock will be no trouble for you!
But you must be in front.  She must follow you.  You must not look back, for if you do, 
even for a moment, you will cease to be leading and she will cease to be following and
she will be lost forever between worlds.”</p>
<p>“Tonight? Why not now?”</p>
<p>“Go tonight while my son and I can watch you from North of the Sky.”</p>
<p>“Ah,” said the tramp.</p>
<p>The bear turned and started to go back down the hill.  Sonja, who had been dumb the whole
while, suddenly shook herself awake and said “Mother, thank you.”</p>
<p>The bear turned and said “Smelly thing, take care of my son's fish. Perhaps she will
come back to me one day. Maybe I will eat her. Maybe she will be my daughter. Do not
lose her.”</p>
<p>“Kay,” said the tramp.</p>
<p>“Smelly thing, you are not Jovius.”</p>
<p>“No, I know that,” said the tramp.</p>
<p>“You are the fatherless son of darkness.”</p>
<p>“Ah. Okay, then.”</p>
<p>And then the bear did go away.</p>
