<h1>Chapter 2010-11-01 - 3</h1>
<p>Poppa and Momma came and went.  They looked greener each time they
came in and their eyes more sunken and their hair less combed and
Poppa's nose and chin and cheeks were getting splotchy with a sort of
a rash.  They never went far, though.  They took turns sleeping in the
blue vinyl chair, reading the same magazines over again, jumping to
attention when the doctor in the blue pajamas pushed back the curtain.</p>
<p>Sonja watched them come and go and listened to the sound of the machine
that was doing her breathing for her. “Hush... hush... hush” it said
as if by making a noise—by moving—she would break its concentration.
“Hush... hush... hush.” There were other sounds in the room, too. A
machine by her head beeped, people outside whispered. The radios of the
paramedics and sometimes police whined. But it was all noise, to Sonja.
“Hush... hush... hush...” was the important thing. “Hush... hush...
hush...” said the machine.</p>
<p>Pajama Doctor came back in. Poppa was in the chair this time, and he
sprang up like a springy toy. Sonja closed her eyes. She was getting
very tired. The doctor was talking to Poppa, but the machine was still
urging silence. Couldn't they hear that? Poppa and the doctor left
together. “Hush... hush... hush...” Sonja listened to the machine
and felt her pulse beat against the needle in her arm and press against
the tape around her thumb.</p>
<p>Soon Poppa and Pajama Doctor came back in with Momma this time. They
had tears in their eyes. Poppa held her hand. Too tightly. Momma
blew her nose. The waves lapping the shore said “Hush... hush...
hush...” They were so loud, Momma and Poppa. They were talking,
yelling. “Hush... hush... hush...” Somewhere, they were yelling,
screaming. “Hush... hush... hush...” Somewhere, beyond the waves.
Calling.  So blue, the waves.  So blue, the sky.  And the sun, so
bright.  And the waves, saying “Hush... hush... hush...”  And somewhere,
somewhere calling, Momma and Poppa.  Calling... what?  “Sonja!” They
were saying “Sonja! Come back!”  Why were they saying that?  And where
were they?  Behind her.  Somewhere behind her, but ahead was only blue
sky, blue waves, bright sun, “Hush... hush... hush...”</p>
<p>And Sonja realizes that even if now she wanted to go back, she no longer
can.  So she steps into the little boat that is there waiting for her.
The waves suck at its sides as it rocks.  The day is so bright and the
sky so clear.  She can hardly see where the water ends and the sky begins.
The little boat drifts away.  She cannot tell how fast, but she can tell
that it is moving.  And she cannot look back.  The little boat travels on.</p>
<p>There are no oars in this little boat.  No life vests.  No picnic basket
or tackle box.  There is a small bench and just enough room for her feet.
And she travels on, ahead, into blue and white and brightness.</p>
<p>Days pass and Sonja does not become hungry.  It does not grow dark upon
that shining sea, but days pass nevertheless.  Months pass.  Sonja's
birthday comes and goes.  She knows the day, but it is not important.
It is something you know, like your time tables or your prayers.</p>
<p>Sonja does not sleep, she does not grow bored or weary.  She does not
look to the right or to the left.  The little boat travels on and Sonja
looks straight ahead into the bright, bright sun that is always just above
the horizon.  The sun has always just risen and Sonja is always moving
toward it.</p>
<p>Until one day, something else appears between Sonja and the sun.  A cloud.
A green cloud. An island.  A continent.  Her little boat continues to
approach it.  There is no breakwater.  The waves have no caps.  Her little
boat comes into a small bay with a sandy beach and then her boat says
“Hush...” as it slides onto the sand and stops.</p>
<p>For the first time, Sonja begins to wonder where she is.  For the first
time, Sonja feels the need to ask questions.  She does not feel afraid.
Merely curious.  She gets out of the boat and her legs are stiff from
months of sitting.  She walks up the beach and the sand is soft and warm
on her bare feet.  Beyond the beach is a dark forest.  She walks into
the forest.  The ground is moss here and pine needles there and everywhere
very soft.  Fallen leaves say “Hush... hush... hush...” as she treds
upon them.</p>
<p>Sonja walks for a very long time.  As she walks, her bones stretch.
Her clothes become tight about her hips, shoulders, chest.  They become
ragged and fall away.</p>
<p>She keeps walking through the forest.  The way is easier now that her
clothes are gone.  Her stride has become longer as well, and her hips
have become accostomed to walking by settling into a comfortable
wideness.  Her hair has grown long.  Her arms have grown long.  At
some point, she becomes aware that she has become a woman, but it is
like her birthday: just a fact.</p>
<p>After she has walked for ten or twelve years, she comes to a clearing.
Something about this clearing makes her stop.  The forest is dark
all around, and she is afraid to enter the bright clearing.  The openness
is strange to her, and for the first time, Sonja is frightened.</p>
<p>Then she hears voices.  They come from behind the trees.  They come
from every direction.  They are saying “Hush... hush... hush...”
The move closer.  Sonja is frightened.  She cannot see who is there,
but she sees that they carry strips of bright fabric.  They are dancing
through the trees around her, just outside of the bright clearing, carrying
bright fabrics.  They say “Hush... hush... hush...” and they dance.
They bob up and down and weave their long ribbons in and out of the trees.
Though Sonja still cannot see them, they begin to weave their ribbons
around Sonja's body.  She is still frightened, but she lets them clothe
her in their ribbons.  Around and around they go, dancing, invisible,
wrapping her in colors, dancing light, flashing silk and cloth-of-gold.
Red and gold and green!  Like the forest itself!  Round and around.
Sonja begins to spin with them, to dance with them.  Clothes appearing
in pieces, materializing from the swirl of fabric, falling about her limbs,
her waist, her legs, her hair.  She skips until her feet no longer touch
the ground and she is swept up with the invisible voices into the dark
canopy above. </p>
