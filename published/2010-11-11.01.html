<h1>Chapter 2010-11-11 - 1</h1>
<p>In the morning, the tramp got directions from Alice to the highway and,
hoisting his backpack on his back, taking up his guitar—wrapped in a
plastic garbage bag for it had begun to rain again—he set out.</p>
<p>As he walked, he thought about his new song, the <em>Ballad of Nowhere,
Oregon</em> and made changes in his minds here and there. That was how he
worked. Timing the rhythms to his footsteps. Ordinarily, he would have
had his guitar in his hand as he walked, but today he had to do without.</p>
<p>As he passed people in the street on the way out of town, he noticed
that everyone here had a hat and no one an umbrella. The tramp had
neither. No home, no hat, no—Jeesus—no name!</p>
<p>Well, names at least were cheap. He'd find a new one when he got to San
Francisco. He could make one up now as he walked. Let's see, who was he?
He was… tall. He was… well. What about his personality? He was…
well he liked coffee and oatmeal.</p>
<p>Plenty of time before he got to San Francisco to think about a new name.
Back to the Ballad                                                     .</p>
<p>Except that it was crap and he knew it. It was too silly to be tragic
and too bloody to be funny. The Ballad Meter he had used sounded like
a nursery rhyme in his ears. He tried to change words here or there,
but they seemed locked in place by the stupid meter. Worse: the more he
worked on the melody, the more it came out sounding like the Theme to
Gilligan's Island.</p>
<p>She told her beau a place he'd know<br />
By night he'd make the trip<br />
They started from this tropic port<br />
Aboard this tiny ship… NO!</p>
<p>His thoughts started going round and round as he tried to work out the
puzzles he had made. And each time they came round, he found himself
trying to find a rhyme for “A Mansion on a Hill.” At first, he
thought it was because somehow he was trying to sing “Tweeter and the
Monkey Man” by The Travelling Wilburys, but it occurred to him that he
had recently visited a mansion on a hill.</p>
<p>And now he saw where he had failed at the directions the first time.
The road turned here, but there was a road that forked from it so that
if you weren't paying attention, you would have walked along the side
street rather than following the main street around the bend. This side
street went steeply up into the hills and, at its top, he could see the
topmost towers of the old mansion.</p>
<p>Well, he'd not make <em>that</em> mistake again! He walked along the main road
that skirted the bottom of the hill and wended, eventually, to the
Interstate.</p>
<p>He'd trusted fate to liberate<br />
And fin'lly got his will.<br />
The nameless beast was free, at least<br />
Of mansions on a hill.`
Now Frisco-bound, the beaten hound<br />
Was sharpening his quill<br />
That he might sign upon the line<br />
“A Mansion on a Hill.”</p>
<p>Fuck!  That didn't even make any sense!  He stopped and stamped his feet.
He had to get control of this silly song or let it go.  It was <em>his</em> song,
after all.  He made it up.  When he got it right, they could make the check
out to… well… that was a problem.</p>
<p>Had he ever known his name?</p>
<p>Of course!</p>
<p>Well? When he knew his name, what was it?</p>
<p>When had he known his name?</p>
<p>When he had left home, sure.  After that?  When was the last time he
used his name?</p>
<p>Demos Something-Foreign-Sounding, the man in the cemetery.  Had he told
him his name?  The tramp couldn't remember.  No, he hadn't, but it wasn't
because he didn't know it.  It was because he didn't like it.  Well he knew
it then, what had happened between then and now.</p>
<p>Well, the obvious answer was “A Mansion on a Hill.”  The place where he
had somehow spent twelve hours and not known it.  What had happened in
those twelve hours.  Had he been struck in the head?</p>
<p>The tramp sighed and swore and then swore again.  He turned around and went
back to the fork in the road.  Then he started to climb the hill.  He had
left his name in that mansion.  The Mansion on the Hill.</p>
