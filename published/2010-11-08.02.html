<h1>Chapter 2010-11-08 - 2</h1>
<p>In the morning, Sonja feasted as before, and the coffee didn't taste as painfully
of unnamed loss.  She explored the palace and found treasures and games.
She found enchanting music boxes and engrossing games.  Anything she wanted was 
provided along with a chorus of whispers.</p>
<p>What she didn't find, though, was any evidence of her nocturnal companion.  As far
as she could see, there was nobody in the house but her and no one in the house
but her and the voices.</p>
<p>She went out into the vinyards in the afternoon, but didn't go near to the creek.
Instead, she gazed across the valley into the dark forest and imagined she could
see great lumbering things moving among the trees.  Then, she looked further and
squinted and strained to see glimpses of the distant ocean with an unexpected
longing.</p>
<p>She thought she saw at last the flash of a wave in the sunlight and the breath
caught in her throat.</p>
<p>And then her throat wouldn't let go of her breath.  She ran back indoors, panting.
In the grand ballroom, she stopped and bent over—hands on knees—and struggled for
breath.  She seal-barked once.  Then she saw the stream that ran through the ballroom
there in front of her.  She looked around, but of course there was no one there to
see her.  Feeling foolish, she wriggled out of her dress until she was standing
exposed in the middle of the cavernous space.  She dipped a toe in the water and
it was as cold as ever.  She shivered, and then coughed again.</p>
<p>All at once, she made up her mind and splashed down into the stream, thrusting her
head under the shallow water.  At first she panicked as the swift-moving water
flowed over her face.  But she forced herself to open her eyes, and then—and this
was the terrifying part—to breathe the water in through her nose.  She felt the
cold water flow down into her chest.  She coughed bubbles into the water.  She
forced in another breath of water, drowning herself.</p>
<p>Soon, however, the water was flowing in and out, in and out, in her nose, out her
mouth, in her nose, out her mouth.</p>
<p>She curled into a ball there in the middle of the stream and found that, somehow,
her lower half had once again become entangled in slick, silver fabric that bound
her legs together as if in one, undivided body.  She hugged her—knee to her chest
and breathed the water and her hair waved about her head like writhing snakes
in the water.</p>
<p>When she was feeling better, she dragged herself out of the stream on her hands.
When her legs came up into the air, their wrapping fell away in thick, fleshy folds
that reminded her of salmon skin.  The meaty, slimy matter fell apart and disolved
into the water, flowing away in silver and pink streams until there was nothing left.</p>
<p>Feeling wet and cold, but breathing more easily now, she retrieved her clothes and,
clutching them to her bare body, fled to the less exposed confines of her bed chamber.</p>
<hr />
<p>That night, she lay in bed unable to sleep, thinking about all the strangeness—wonderful
and terrible—that she had experienced since… since she came here.</p>
<p>After she had lain in the bed for a time, she heard footsteps coming down the hallway.
They grew nearer and then the door opened.  An enormous man entered the room quietly
and began to undress.  He was a shadow among shadows, but she could hear his deep
breathing like a bellows exciting a fire.  He carefully removed his garments one
at a time, folded them and put them on a chair until he stood naked before her.  For
all his enormity, he was well proportioned: slender of waist, broad of chest and 
shoulder, thick of arm and thigh.</p>
<p>He came to the bed and she could smell him: that musky, warm smell that somehow both
soothed and excited her.  He lifted the covers and slid into bed next to her an his
body was cold.  She hesitated for a moment, and then wrapped her arms around him to
warm him.  He let out a deep, rumbling sigh and stroked her hair with a great calloused
hand.  Soon, his hand moved to her shoulder and became still and he began to breathe
more softly and slowly.  She continued to hold him until she, too, fell asleep.</p>
<p>In the morning, he was gone.</p>
