<h1>Chapter 2010-11-30 - 4</h1>
<p>Mitchell was thoroughly confused now.  First, sounds seemed to come from the right, then
from the left.  Then it was as if someone was whispering to her, just behind the next tree.
She spun about.  There was the sound of whispering all around her.  All the sounds seemed to
come from every direction at once.  Like a chorus of invisible people all around her, whispering
to her.</p>
<p>She ran on.  At some point, she found that she was no longer chasing the noises, but fleeing
them.  It made no difference, however.  Whispers surrounded her as the beam of her flashlight bounced from
treetrunk to treetrunk in the pouring rain.</p>
<p>Mitchell tripped on something and fell on her face.  The something said “Ow!”  It was the tramp, still
handcuffed, leaning against the tree in the rain and the dark.</p>
<p>“Fuck!” said Mitchell.</p>
<p>“You're telling me!” said the Tramp.</p>
<p>“There are things in this woods.”</p>
<p>“Have you seen her?”</p>
<p>“Seen who?”</p>
<p>“Sonja!”</p>
<p>Mitchell shone her light on the tramp and examined him more closely than she had before.  He was covered
with bite marks.  His clothes were torn and muddy.  One wound on his neck was bleeding quite freely.  His
eyes looked heavy.</p>
<p>“Shit,” said Mitchell, pressing her hands to the wound, “Shit!”</p>
<p>“She needs, I don't know what she needs.  Let me sing to her.  Let me sing to her.”</p>
<p>“You're delerious.  What did this to you?”</p>
<p>There was a crash behind her.  Mitchell spun around and fell next to the tramp in the mud.  She pointed
her flashlight in the direction of the sound and caught Scroter coming out of the underbrush.  He was
stunned by the sudden light and tried to shield his face.</p>
<p>“Scroter?” said Mitchell.</p>
<p>“Officer Mitchell? Is that you? Is Sheriff Cold with you?”</p>
<p>“Scroter,” said Mitchell starting to rise, “You're under arrest for the murder of…”</p>
<p>“What? No! You can't…” he glanced quickly into the shadows, “No… no, that's fine.  Yes. I'll come with you.
We'll sort this out…”</p>
<p>Mitchell was on her feet and was about to approach Scroter when something burst out of the bushes.</p>
<p>“Sonja?” said the tramp.</p>
<p>Mitchell shone her light on the new person; it was indeed a woman.  It was the teenage girl she had seen run
out of the house.  Her eyes were still yellow and she hissed at Scroter.  Her teeth were jagged, like shark's
teeth.  Mitchell froze with fear. She was too stupified to think to turn off her flashlight, but followed the
action with its bright beam out of pure instinct.</p>
<p>The girl was approaching Scroter slowly.  Scroter tried to run away, but a second figure emerged behind him.
Another female.  This one too had shark-like teeth, but her eyes flashed silver in the spotlight.  They advanced
on Scroter and he tried to dodge them, but they herded him in.  At last, he broke into a run and they chased him.
He didn't make it ten feet before they were on him.  They stripped his shirt from his back and began clawing and
biting at him.  The pale flesh in the bright light quickly darkened with shining ruby light.  The more they scratched
and bit, the darker the blood became.  They went for his neck, his arms, his legs.  The tore at his chest.  He screamed.
There was a crack.  He stopped screaming.  A gleam of white turned out to be a rib.  More red, more white. The girls
were lying belly down in the mud, now, like lionesses over a destroyed water buffalo.  Scroter's head fell toward
Mitchell and half his cheek had been torn away, revealing the red and yellow rictus of his skull beneath.  His ribs
jutted naked into the air as the girls ripped and tore still more flesh from his skeleton with their teeth.</p>
<p>Eventually, they seemed to be satisfied.  They seemed to grow disinterested in the corpse of Scroter.  They looked around.
That is when they noticed Mitchell standing there with her shaking flashlight.  The stood up.  They were drenched head to
foot in blood so that only splotches on their foreheads showed any pale flesh color.  Their eyes shone in the flashlight
beam, one yellow, one silver.  The seemed not to be able to stand entirely erect as they began to move toward Officer
Mitchell.</p>
<p>And then the tramp began to sing.  Or perhaps he had been singing before, but his voice was so weak, that Mitchell had
not heard.  Now his voice became strong enough to be heard over the howling trees.  He sang a children's song.  My
Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean.  Sang it in a wavering, sad voice.  He sang it like a lover, missing his Bonny.  And the
girls stopped and listened.  He sang with pain and longing, and Mitchell saw that longing in those strange eyes.  Longing,
now, human longing, not animal hunger.  And they stood a little more erect, and their strange eyes dulled.  And they
closed their grinning mouths.  And one of them said “My Orpheus?”</p>
