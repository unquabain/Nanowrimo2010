<h1>Chapter 2010-11-27 - 5</h1>
<p>Cold was having trouble keeping the squad car on the road as the rain and the
wind pelted it.  Despite his hurry, he had to take the winding curves up
the hill to the Bart mansion slowly.  It was unpaved and the wheels slipped
in the sloppy mud.  Somehow, the wind seemed to blow right through the false
cedars.</p>
<p>Mitchell and Gibson had caught up with them as they were leaving the town and
the two cars had proceded together up the hill.</p>
<p>Cold had never felt so impatient in his whole life.  The gimpses of the house
he could see through the blurred windshied and the thrashing trees never seemed
to get closer as the he swerved and slid up the mud track in what felt to him like
a snail's pace.  There was the silhouette and then, around a bend and another
twenty feet up the hill and there it was again, receding into the fog and rain,
as if he were chasing the house itself through the woods and not a demented
science teacher.</p>
<p>The car went around corners like a boat, its rear end spinning out behind it
and Cold struggling to counter-steer to get it back in line with the road.
The last stretch was fairly straight away and Cold let his impatience get the
better of him.  He floored the accelerator.  At first, the car seemed not to
respond at all as the wheels slipped in the mud, but then they must have
caught a rock or something because it bolted forward and he and Officer Henry
were thrust back into their seats.</p>
<p>Just then, the headlights flashed across something in the road ahead, some sort
of an animal was in the road.  It looked to Cold in the instant that he saw it
like a huge hunchback—some sort of half-man, half-gorilla staggaring through the rain.
Cold swerved and the car went into a spin.
Cold spun the wheel right and then left and then back, trying to gain control
of the car.  The car rocked and bucked as it went off the road and crashed
into bushes and small trees.  Finally the car struck a massive old trunk and
came to a stop with a crash that shattered the windshield.  Henry had bumped
his head against his window and cracked the glass.  He was dazed, but not
unconscious.  Cold stumbled out into the rain and came around to Henry's side.
He pulled the stupified policeman from the vehicle and hoisted him onto his
back.  Slipping and crawling through the mud with Henry piggy-back, Cold finally
made it back up to the road.</p>
<p>There was no sign of the other car.</p>
<p>Cold sat Henry against the trunk of a tree and shined his flashlight into his
face.  Henry's head was bleeding and he wouldn't track the flashlight with his
eyes.</p>
<p>Cold ripped off his jacket and tore the sleeve from his uniform.  He tied it
tightly around Henry's head.  Then he unscrewed the cap of his flashlight so
that it shone like a beacon and tucked it under Henry's arm.  Then he rose
and began to run up the street looking for the other car.  Even if it had
been run off the road as he had, there should have been lights, but he
could see none except the lights from his own wreck and a dim light coming
from the upper storey of the mansion.</p>
<p>Now, at last, the house seemed to have come closer.  Suddenly, it seemed far
too close, looming above him.</p>
<p>Cold stood in the rain trying to calm his racing thoughts.  What to do.  There
was someone in the house, clearly, but he had no real evidence that the teacher
had come here.  The light might well be Mitchell and Gibson moving about the mansion
with flashlights and finding it empty.  Meanwhile, here was Henry with a serious
head wound.</p>
<p>Cold stood in the road and let the rain fall on him, cooling his head, waiting for
his sense to come back to him and tell him what to do.  After a few deep breaths,
he picked up the radio from its clip on his shoulder and depressed the button.</p>
<p>“Mitchell,” he said, “Cold.  Henry's been hurt.  Where are you?”</p>
<p>He listened.  There was nothing but static.</p>
<p>“Mitchell, report!”</p>
<p>“Cold,” said a female voice on the radio.</p>
<p>“Mitchell, where are you?”</p>
<p>“Here,” said the voice.</p>
<p>Cold looked up at the mansion.  Despite the freezing rain, he was still aware of a
chill going down his spine.</p>
<p>“Mitchell?”</p>
<p>“Cold,” said the voice, “Here.”</p>
<p>Cold took off at a run toward the mansion, mud flying from the back of his boots.
The wind tried to knock him over.  The rain blinded him.  He gained the steps.
He slipped and barked his shin on the top step.  He made it to the door.  It was locked again.
Not it was torn from its hinges and Cold was inside.  The wind curled in behind him and blew
about the room, raising the dust from the floors and searching behind every tattered curtain.</p>
<p>The lights upstairs.  Cold took the stairs two at a time until he burst into the attic.
This time it was not empty.  The Greek knelt in the middle of the room, some sort of machine
next to him.  A tube was attached to his neck and the machine was churning away, sucking the
life's blood from him.</p>
<p>Cold ran to the machine and ripped the elastic bands that held the tube tightly to the Greek's
neck.  He collapsed, blood bubbling from the twin wounds on the neck in the center of the purple
bruise.  Cold pressed his hand to the wound and looked around for something to use as a tourniquette.
As he looked over his shoulder, the other man in the room struck him in the head with a candlestick.</p>
