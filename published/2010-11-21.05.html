<h1>Chapter 2010-11-21 - 5</h1>
<p>The tramp ran away, feeling the thud of the dirt strike each foot and
the shock of that run up through his legs and shake his pelvis and
strike at his heart, which pounded back and thrust his other foot out
for the next flying step.</p>
<p>He half stumbled down the path until he fell knee deep into the cold
stream at the bottom of the hill. The coldness of the water shocked him
and he stopped.</p>
<p>His foot slipped on the slimy rocks and he fell into the water,
sputtering and floundering until he found something firm to pull himself
up on. He dragged himself onto the bank and rested on the grass on the
forest side of the stream.</p>
<p>After a while, he looked up to the hill where the house had been before
and, just like the previous night, he saw nothing there except…
perhaps in the dim light of the stars he saw a black shape on the top of
the hill like a cairn. The rock on which the woman slept with her bear.</p>
<p>He stopped and listened. There were no whispering voices on this side
of the stream. So, on the balance, he figured he'd be safer if he spend
the night in the forest. Bears, after all, were natural things. He could
climb a tree and sleep there. Bears couldn't climb trees, could they.
Actually, he rather thought they could. Maybe they didn't like to climb
trees.</p>
<p>He stumbled through the forest looking for a likely tree. It was rapidly
getting darker and the thick canopy of leaves was blocking even the
remaining light out. If he didn't find a roost soon, he was not going to
be able to.</p>
<p>He had found a tree that looked like it would be impossible for a bear
to climb and was just considering whether it would, in fact, be possible
for him to climb it when he heard a growl behind in.</p>
<p>He had also heard about bears that when you are standing, they think you
are challenging them. The thing to do is throw yourself on the ground
and pretend to be dead. But somehow, the tramp found himself absolutely
frozen in place, unable to bend his knees or move his arms.</p>
<p>The growl stopped and a voice, no less menacing, said “You do not
belong here.”</p>
<p>Not a bear, then. He found he could now move his legs. He turned and saw
in the dim light…</p>
<p>…a bear!</p>
<p>Shit.</p>
<p>“You do not belong here,” said the bear again.</p>
<p>“Okay,” said the tramp.</p>
<p>“You are trying to steal the lady away from her husband. I knew you
would come.”</p>
<p>“The lady… oh shit! You're the bear! You can have the guitar back!
It's too nice for me anyway! I'm sorry about the shirt, it's just I
bleed, I couldn't…”</p>
<p>“What are you saying? Be quiet! You make too much noise.”</p>
<p>“Here!” said the tramp, holding out the black guitar which, somehow,
he had held on to throughout his flight.</p>
<p>“Did she give you that?” asked the bear.</p>
<p>“Y-yes. She said her husband wouldn't mind.”</p>
<p>“It was hers to give. It is yours now. What else did she give you?”</p>
<p>“These clothes. Some food.”</p>
<p>“Take the clothes and the instrument and leave. If you try to take her
away from her husband, I will eat you.”</p>
<p>“I believe it! Only, are… are you her husband?”</p>
<p>In nearly complete darkness, the tramp saw some movement of the great
black mass that was the bear. It almost seemed as if the bear cocked its
head.</p>
<p>“Are you stupid?”</p>
<p>“Yes! Completely! I saw her sleeping with a bear, and I thought…”</p>
<p>“That is my son, and he is not a bear. He is a god. Do you know what a
god is?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“You cannot. It is impossible.”</p>
<p>“But I do!” said the tramp, and he thought he must suddenly have
become suicidal, but he continued “I know what gods are!”</p>
<p>“I have heard your songs, story-teller. Your gods are silly and vain.
They are people dressed in the clothes of gods playing at powers.”</p>
<p>“No, no, listen,” he said and pulled the guitar strap over his head
and started to play a song he had heard before only in his head. In his
great repertoire of songs, it was the only song he had never played for
anyone. It was the song he made up while he was walking, while he was
sleeping in cemeteries and while he was licking his wounds and wondering
why. It wasn't a song about gods, exactly. He hadn't ever thought of it
being a song about gods. He hadn't known what, exactly, it was about.
He supposed that it was a love song for a woman he had yet to meet, but
playing it now for the bear, he decided that it was for her. It was
always meant for her.  Not that he had ever imagined he would need to
play a song for a talking bear in the middle of the night by an enchanged
mansion, but somehow, he had been preparing for it in his mind.</p>
<p>When he was done, he let the last chord ring on the strings and decay
naturaly before lifting his cold-cramped fingers from the fretboard.</p>
<p>The bear said nothing for a while, and then she said “you know nothing
of gods.”  But she said it quietly, almost sullenly.  Then she added
“I will not eat you tonight.  Go away.”</p>
<p>“I don't know how,” he said.  “I wish I could.”</p>
<p>“Go back the way you came,” said the bear.</p>
<p>“I tried that. It didn't work.”</p>
<p>“Why did you come here?”</p>
<p>“I came… it was an accident.  I didn't mean to come here.  I was just
looking for… for my name.”</p>
<p>“Your name is not here. You came to steal my son's wife from him.”</p>
<p>“What, her? No! What <em>is</em> she?  Is she a vampire?”</p>
<p>“You do that to her. You were not meant to come here. It is not natural
that you and she be together. You corrupt her.”</p>
<p>The bear was silent for a while and the tramp didn't know how to respond
to that.  Finally the bear said to him “I will give you three days to find
the way back to your home, and then I will eat you. I enjoyed your songs,
but you will not take my son's wife from him and you will not turn her
into a lamia.  She is a skinny fish, but my son loves her.”</p>
<p>Then the bear ambled off.  The tramp suddenly found he was in command
of his knees again and he scooted up the tree trunk as if he were propelled
by a spring.</p>
