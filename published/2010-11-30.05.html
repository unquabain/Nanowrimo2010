<h1>Chapter 2010-11-30 - 5</h1>
<p>After a while, Cold got tired of punching the Colonel, who seemed to have eyes
only for the charm bracelet, despite his swollen and bloody face.  He picked up
Ioannou, who was unconscious, but still breathing, and carried him out of the attic.</p>
<p>Outside, the storm had stopped.  Completely stopped.  The clouds were beginning
to break up and be carried away by the cold, damp wind.  Cold stepped out onto
the muddy road and saw two sets of burning headlamps on either side of the road
ahead.  Henry and Gibson were working on trying to get one back onto the road.</p>
<p>Cold looked at the stars that were beginning to come out for a moment before
he went to join them and find someplace warm for Ioannou, but in that instant
of reflection, he heard music coming from the woods.  Singing.</p>
<p>Cold, Ioannou on his shoulder like a sack of flour, stepped into the woods and
walked toward the sound.</p>
<p>He found four and a half people gathered in a little clear space.  Officer
Mitchell was removing the handcuffs from the tramp he had arrested earlier,
while the latter was singing his heart out to two muddy girls, who seemed
to be in a sort of a trance.</p>
<p>Officer Mitchell's flashlight happened to sweep across them carelessly and
he saw that they were not muddy at all, but covered in blood.  A human
carcass lay dismembered and disemboweled in the bushes.  Cold drew his gun.</p>
<p>“Freeze!” said Cold.  The girls looked at him and, for a moment, their eyes
seemed to catch a strange light from Mitchell's flashlight, but then the moment
passed and one of them called out “Daddy!”</p>
<p>She ran to Cold, despite his drawn weapon, and grabbed at the man on Cold's
shoulder.  She helped Cold to lay him on the ground and she began to fawn
over him.</p>
<p>Cold was about to push her away until he could find some more answers when
the other girl said “Cold?”</p>
<p>Cold looked more closely at the other girl.</p>
<p>“Cold,” she said again.</p>
<p>Cold got out his flashlight and pointed it's bright beam directly at her.
Her face was a dark purple mask of blood, but under it, in the eyes, something
familiar.</p>
<p>She wiped her hand and somehow much of the blood smeared off, and more of her
face shone through.  And Cold dropped his flashlight.</p>
<p>“Penny!” he said and he closed the distance and picked her up in his arms,
bloodying his uniform further.</p>
<p>“Why, Penny!  You're… you're still a girl!”</p>
<p>“No, Cold.  I'm not.  I haven't been for a long time.”</p>
<p>“Sonja,” mumbled a deep voice from behind Cold.  Ioannou was rousing a little. 
“Sonja, my little girl?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Daddy,” said the other girl.  “Oh! But I'm a mess! I'm covered in… oh
don't look at me.”</p>
<p>She started to turn away from him, but his weak hand reached out and grabbed
her.</p>
<p>“My little girl,” he said, “I've missed you.  The man was right.  He said I would
get to see you again, and he was right.  It was worth it, Sonja.  My little girl.
It was worth it.”</p>
<p>There was a rush of cold, wet wind all about them and Officer Mitchell drew her gun.</p>
<p>There was the sound of a man laughing.  Cold looked around, but he couldn't see anyone.</p>
<p>“I'm going home, now, Cold.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Penny.  Come home.”</p>
<p>“No, Cold.  I'm going to my home now.”</p>
<p>And Cold was aware of a man standing behind her in the shadows that seemed to evade
his flashlight.  He seemed to be wearing a baggy white clown suit with a black mask
that covered his eyes and nose.  He was laughing.</p>
<p>And then Penny was gone.  And the man was gone.  And Ioannou closed his eyes and gave
a deep sigh and he, too, was gone.</p>
<p>The remaining girl laid her head on his chest and she was weeping, but smiling at the
same time.</p>
<p>“Sonja?” said the tramp.  “Sonja, are you alright?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Orpheus. I know where he's gone. I've seen it. And I'm happy. Oh! I want to see the stars!”</p>
<p>And she ran off into the woods.</p>
<p>“Hey!” said Officer Mitchell and she and Cold ran after her, the tramp following as closely behind
as his weakened legs could manage.</p>
<p>They found her in the road, staring at the now totally clear sky.  Cold cuffed her and began to mirandize her, but she
ignored him.  When the tramp emerged from the woods, she turned to him.</p>
<p>“Sonja.  We'll figure a way.  I'll find a song to sing that makes it right.  I'll find a song.”</p>
<p>“Oh, Orpheus.  There is no song for this,” she looked at the sky. “Mother Bear was right.
We're not meant to be together.  We turn into monsters.  I become a monster.  That man in
the woods was a monster.  When we're together, we become monsters.  It's not how it
was made to work.”</p>
<p>“So what, then?”</p>
<p>“I'll go back to him.  I'll tell him I'm sorry.  I'll ask him to take me back.”</p>
<p>“How will you get back?”</p>
<p>She turned to the West.  “The way I got there in the first place.  Across the ocean. Now
that I've seen his face, maybe we can live together.  Maybe it was a test.  Maybe there
will be more tests, but I'll do them.”  She handed Cold back his handcuffs, which somehow
were no longer closed around her wrists, and she kissed the tramp.  “I'll go West to the
ocean, and then I'll swim to him across the ocean.  Goodbye.”</p>
<p>And she walked off into the woods.  Cold tried to chase after her, but somehow, though she
seemed to be walking as if in a daze, he couldn't keep up with her and he had to turn
back before he got lost in the woods.</p>
