<h1>Chapter 2010-11-12 - 1</h1>
<p>As the tramp climbed the hill, the rain began to come down harder.  Not now the perpetual drizzle
of the Pacific Northwest.  This was a solid, midwestern rain.  The dirt road became slippery and
muddy.  The branches of the false cedars hung low across his path.  More than once, the tramp 
slipped and fell to his knees in the mud, but he had now made up his mind.</p>
<p>It occurred to the tramp to wonder what he might find at the top of the hill.  Would he find the
magnificent home, bright with light and the strange people within?  Or would he perhaps find the
tumble-down pile with its broken windows and defiled walls in which the Sheriff had found him?</p>
<p>He had just about made up his mind that the only logical explanation was that somehow he had dreamed
the fantastic story of the house with its under-aged wife and over-weight husband and… the third
person.  See?  That was proof enough that it was a dream: that he couldn't remember the third person
he had met in the house.  That was the way of dreams, wasn't it?  Things that were so clear one
moment slipped from your memory entirely the next.  Dreams were exceedingly strange that way.
Were they really ever as vivid as you thought they were just upon waking?  Or does the memory fade
because it was never truly there?  Do you only have the feeling of having been somewhere else,
someone else?  Is it the feeling that makes you think the dream must have been vivid if only you
could remember it?</p>
<p>Convinced now that he was journeying up a hill to find an abandoned, old grey mansion, he was 
stupified when he turned a corner and found a brighly lit manor with ripe pumpkins in the garden
and garlands on the door.  Lights burned in every window and he thought he heard cheerful music
coming from within.  Haprsichord, perhaps?  Violin?</p>
<p>The rain was coming down incredibly hard, now.  Branches were being blown from the trees and
crashing to the ground.  He opened the gate in the little, white fence and the wind tore it
from his hand so that it swung violently back upon its fence with a loud crack.</p>
<p>The tramp went forward.  The rain seemed to be blowing directly under his collar now and filling
up his pants pockets.  His socks were swollen sponges in his shoes.  Half-way through the garden,
the wind actuall blew him over onto his hands and knees.  But he got up and climbed the steps
onto the porch.</p>
<p>There was definitely music coming from within.  He knocked on the door, but the sound of the wind
drowned out any noise he could make.  He knocked louder, but he couldn't even hear the noise himself.
He glanced over his shoulder and saw a darkness in the sky racing for him.  A black, vertical shelf
of cloud, dipping down from the sky and coming like a truck.  He knocked again as hard as he could
and the door swung open.</p>
<p>The tramp ducked inside and turned around as an enormous drop in air pressure hit the house and nearly
sucked him back out of the house again.  As it was, it slammed the door behind him with an echoing
bang the tramp was afraid might have damaged the door.</p>
<p>The strange thing was, though, that as soon as his ears recovered from the loud noise, he could no
longer hear the wind.  It was as if the door were lead lined and the room filled with sand.  It was
exceedingly bright inside... or...</p>
<p>...not inside.  He was outside.  The sun was behind him.  It was warm
and bright and cloudless.  He could hear birds.  He looked at the door again.  It was the same door
except… well, he was still looking at the outside of the door.  He was still standing on the deck
of the house.</p>
<p>He walked down the steps into the garden.  No pumpkins here.  Tomatoes were ripening on the vine,
peas on others.  He looked back at the house.  It was the same house… sort of.  It was bigger, he
thought.</p>
<p>He had stepped through the door, he was sure of that.  He had stepped into one house and out of
another in one step.</p>
<p>He looked back at the road.  But while the house had the same door wand was sort of the same house,
the hill on which it stood was entirely different.  This looked less like Oregon and more like Napa.
Vinyards rolled down the hill and the next one was thickly wooded.</p>
<p>He looked at his feet, still muddy and wet, and saw that the dry dust had other footprints.  He walked
a little way along the dusty path, listening to sweet summer birds singing somewhere nearby.  There
footprints in the dust were all the same size, all barefoot.  Some coming, some going.  Never shod,
all small, like a small woman's or a large child's.</p>
<p>He pulled the damp plastic from his guitar and examined it.  He struck a chord.  Twang! The notes came
out buzzing and metallic.  Damn!  The neck had somehow gotten torqued.</p>
<p>He set it on the deck, just out of the direct sunlight and hoped that it might unwarp as it dried.  Then
he sat on the step and tried to think about what to do next.</p>
