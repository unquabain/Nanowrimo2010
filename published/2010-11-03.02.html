<h1>Chapter 2010-11-03 - 2</h1>
<p>Jovius was almost asleep when something struck him in the rib cage. The
caretaker had found him! Time to run. He bolted up, but a strong hand
slapped him on the shoulder and pushed him back down to the ground. The
owner of the hand slid down next to him, nearly on top of him.</p>
<p>Jovius was caught. He stared straight ahead, waiting. After a few
moments, the body next to him, the strong arm on his shoulder, when
nothing was said, Jovius looked at the man. It was the father from the
child's funeral. The man also staired straight ahead at the little pond
some yards away.</p>
<p>It was almost dark. The caretaker would be making his rounds soon.
Jovius began to feel panic. There wasn't much time, certainly no time to
be confused.</p>
<p>“Can I help you with something?” asked Jovius.</p>
<p>“You have booze,” said the man. He had an accent. Jovius wasn't good
with accents.</p>
<p>“No, I... No.”</p>
<p>“Give me some,” said the man. Jovius was thinking of a way to deny
it when the man looked him in the eyes. Those dead eyes. They sucked
at Jovius. Without a further thought, Jovius pulled out the half-empty
bottle of cheap rum in his bag and handed it to the father. The man took
a swig and wiped his mouth on his sleeve. He held the bottle in front of
Jovius with a nod to say “Now you.”</p>
<p>Jovius noticed that, in taking the bottle, the man had released Jovius'
shoulder. He could run if he wanted. Dead eyes waited for him to take
the bottle. Or to run. Dead eyes didn't care what Jovius did.</p>
<p>Jovius drank.</p>
<p>“It's a pretty spot, you think?” said Dead Eyes at last.</p>
<p>“Look, man, if you want to be alone, I can...”</p>
<p>“Pretty pond. Pretty trees.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I guess. There going to be dead in a month,” said the part of
Jovius that deliberately said things to get him into trouble. The man,
however, only nodded and stared at the pond.</p>
<p>Jovius offered him the bottle back after a while. The man looked at it
as if trying to identify a new insect, then took it and drank.</p>
<p>“Rough day?” said Jovius. Dead eyes looked directly at Jovius for
the second time. Now Jovius was the insect. The wind seemed to stop in
the trees for a moment. The grass grew a millimeter back into the soil.
Then the moment broke and the man laughed out loud. Then he laughed
harder until Jovius could hear the echo from the monuments on the far
side of the pond.</p>
<p>“Hey, look, ssh!” said Jovius. “The caretaker!”</p>
<p>“Fuck him!” said the man. “Fuck him for ——” Jovius didn't
quite catch what the man said next, but it didn't matter.</p>
<p>“The caretaker!” said Jovius again, pointing to the black sedan that
was winding its way among the cemetery roads.</p>
<p>“Oh fuck!” said the man, “what do we do?”</p>
<p>“Well you, you're <em>supposed</em> to be here...”</p>
<p>The man looked into Jovius' eyes for a third time and the look said
he was not going to laugh this time. The look said that he could kill
Jovius for suggesting that he was supposed to be in the cemetery that
day.</p>
<p>“Come on,” said Jovius. He scooped up his guitar and backpack and
darted behind the monument. The man scooped up Jovius' blanket and
folowed.</p>
<p>The caretaker had seen them and chased.  The man and Jovius ran from
monument to monument.  They forced the caretaker to get out of the
car with his flashlight and follow them on foot.  They gave him a merry
chase and wound up on the far side of the cemetery.  Jovius spotted a
small chapel with a small stone bench built into one wall.  He used this
as a step and vaulted up onto its tiled roof.  The man followed swiftly
and Jovius caught the man's hand to help him up.  They got far enough
back on the roof that when the caretaker came around the corner of the
road, they were hidden from view.  The caretaker swept his flashlight
back and forth through the gloom and paced carefully around the chapel
and nearby monuments.  When he was out of site, Jovius glanced at the
man and was surprised to see those eyes scrunched up in a smile.  Small
lines radiated like sun rays from the folds below.  He looked as if
he were about to laugh.  Jovius put a hand over the man's mouth because
the caretaker was coming back around the other side of the chapel.</p>
<p>After pacing back and forth for a while more, the caretaker finally
gave up and went back to his car.</p>
<p>Jovius took his hand from the man's mouth.  The man was still smiling,
but didn't look as if he would laugh without warning.</p>
<p>“Demos,” said the man, “Ioannou.”</p>
<p>Jovius wasn't sure what name to give.  He didn't feel like either 
Jovius or Martin today.  So he said “Hey.”</p>
<p>They found a pair of chimneys on opposite sides of the roof and
each claimed one as his own, wedging their bodies on the upper
edge.  Demos tossed Jovius his blanket, while he took his black cashmere
coat off and used that as a blanket.</p>
<p>Jovius pretended to sleep while he watched the shadow of the strange
man in the night as he, in turn, pretended to sleep.</p>
