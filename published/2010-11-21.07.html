<h1>Chapter 2010-11-21 - 7</h1>
<p>In the morning, the tramp could see the roof of the house on top of the hill
through the leaves.</p>
<p>He started down the tree, but it was a long way down a smooth trunk.  He found
it extremely awkward and wound up falling on his butt into a large fern that he
found.  He landed harder than he needed to just the same, because he was hugging
the black guitar.</p>
<p>Well, now he had a deadline, he had to find that door.  He marched up the vinyard
path to the house. He stepped up onto the porch, put his hand on the knob.  He leaned
over and listened to the door.  He was certain he could hear howling wind and
slashing rain on the other side.  So he yanked the door open!</p>
<p>Nothing but house inside.  He closed the door.  He held the handle and concentrated
until he imagined the metal growing colder under his hand.  Then he yanked the door
open again and found more inside inside.</p>
<p>He stepped inside and closed the door after him.  He examined it closely.  It looked
like a door.  He opened it and ran through it as he had two days before.  He wound
up in bright sunlight.</p>
<p>He heard laughing.  Sonja was standing in the vinyard.  Her laugh was pleasant, like
the sound of the stream that ran through the house and the valley.  All the same, it
irritated the tramp.</p>
<p>“What are you doing, no-name?”</p>
<p>“Trying to find the door,” he said shortly.</p>
<p>“I'm fairly certain that you have found it,” she said with a laugh in her voice.</p>
<p>The tramp grimaced and said nothing.  In stead, he closed the door and leaned his
head against the glass.  He closed his eyes and concentrated on wind and rain.
Just as he thought he had blocked out the sunshine and birds and sweet smells
of the vinyard and had immersed himself in a stormy, cold day in another world,
he opened his eyes and saw…</p>
<p>…the warm brown eyes of Sonja, who had come up onto the deck and had leaned her
head against the door the way he had and was watching him.</p>
<p>Startled, he took several steps back.  She quickly grabbed him and kept him from
tripping over a flower pot that was behind him.</p>
<p>“Not again!” she said, and laughed.</p>
<p>Then she became serious.</p>
<p>“Why are you afraid of me?” </p>
<p>“What are you?” he asked.</p>
<p>“What? I'm Sonja! I live here!  I'm a… a woman.  What… what do you want me to be?”</p>
<p>“I want you to be a woman.”</p>
<p>“Well, there you go!” she said brightly.  “What shall we do today?  Will you sing
to me again?”</p>
<p>“Sure,” said the tramp, impatiently. “Are there any more doors to this place?”</p>
<p>Sonja shrugged. “Maybe.  Let's walk.”</p>
<p>She took his hand and lead him down from the porch into the bright morning sunlight.</p>
<p>“Do remember…” the tramp started to ask, but when she looked at him, her quizzical
face was so open and sincere that he could not in his mind superimpose the sharp-toothed,
fish-eyed monster that had twiced come for him, and so he finished his sentence weakly: 
“…your dreams?”</p>
<p>Sonja shrugged. “Maybe. Sometimes.”</p>
<p>“Tell me one,” said the tramp.</p>
<p>Sonja walked for a moment without saying anything, her arm hooked in his like they
were a courting couple in an old period romance.  The tramp was about to repeat
the request when Sonja looked up at the sky and said “I'm lying in a bed, and there
are people all around.  They have such serious, sad faces.  And they're all looking
down at me and saying ‘tsk, tsk tsk’ like I've done something.  There are two of them
that have these dark eyes, so dark.  Sunken in like… even in this bright, bright room
where I'm lying, I can't see the back of those shadows.  A man and a woman, and their
eyes are so dark, I can't even see them.”</p>
<p>“Who are they?”</p>
<p>“Dream people.”</p>
<p>“What do you think they think you've done?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I don't know.  It's just a dream.”</p>
<p>“Tell me about your husband,” said the tramp.</p>
<p>“Aren't you full of questions?”</p>
<p>“Describe him to me and I'll make up a song about him.”</p>
<p>“Well, he's big and strong and he smells like… he smells like home.”</p>
<p>“Fireplace and old carpet and soup bubbling away in the kitchen?”</p>
<p>“No!” laughed Sonja.  “He smells like wind and stars and infinite, black skies.
Is that strange?  That's strange, isn't it?  I don't know what I'm saying.”</p>
<p>“That's not what my home smelled like.”</p>
<p>“Forget it.  Sing me an adventure song.”</p>
<p>“You're going to run through all my songs pretty quickly at this rate.”</p>
<p>“No I'm not.  You can't run out of songs.”</p>
<p>“Course I can.”</p>
<p>“No,” she said, sobering up slightly.  “I can see it there,” she touched a spot
between his eyebrows with her finger.  Then her serious moment passed like a 
small cloud in the bright, blue sky and she said “and anyway, so what? Sing me
a song you've already sung, I don't care.  I like them all.”</p>
<p>He swung around his guitar and started to sing a song that he hadn't sung to her before.
It wasn't an adventure song.  It wasn't even a song he made up. He just started singing
and it was what felt like the natural thing to sing.</p>
<p>When he was done, she said “is that true?”</p>
<p>“About being lonely?”</p>
<p>“About your mother being of the sky and your father being of the earth.”</p>
<p>“No. I mean maybe.  I don't know what it means.  I didn't write it.  It's by The Beatles.
They wrote some trippy shit… stuff.”</p>
<p>“And you're of the universe. I feel that way, sometimes.”</p>
<p>“About your parents?”</p>
<p>“The whole thing.  Only… only sometimes I think… no, it doesn't matter what I think.”</p>
<p>“Why not?  What else could possibly matter more here?”</p>
<p>“Well, what you think for a start.”</p>
<p>“Why?” asked the tramp, “what does it matter what I think?”</p>
<p>“Well, you're so… You're so <em>real!</em>”  And when she said that, she licked her lips, and the tramp,
who had started to fall into the rhythm of the conversation, thought that as she blinked he saw
a flash of silver in those brown eyes.</p>
