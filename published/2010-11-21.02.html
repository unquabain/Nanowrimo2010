<h1>Chapter 2010-11-21 - 2</h1>
<p>“He's unscientific,” complained Mr. Scroter, “he thinks he's in
an episode of Dexter or CSI rather. He wants to jump always to the most
sallaceous conclusion. He never sticks to the evidence that is before
him.”</p>
<p>Cold was sitting in the high school classroom listening to the teacher
complain about the partner Cold had assigned to him. To be fair, Cold
had asked. He wanted to get both sides of this story. But after a while,
Cold found his attention beginning to wander. He glanced about the
room, noticing small details. This was, after all, the room in which
two of his three victims had spent an hour of every weekday. Typical
science classroom. Cabinets with heavy padlocks. A plastic replica
of a skeleton. Various mounted stuffed animals, some in quite poor
condition. A fox was missing one glass eye and there was a large bird
which seemed almost denuded of feathers. There were sinks and glassware
to be washed. The students were gearing up for the annual science fair,
and there were posterboard cut-outs on many of the spare tables with the
usual assortment of hand-drawn graphs and printed out web pages. More
Wikipedia here than last year, Cold noted.</p>
<p>“Tell me about the feather.”</p>
<p>“What feather?”</p>
<p>“Jerry said you had a disagreement about a feather. The one that was
found in the wound.”</p>
<p>“To be clear, we did not find a <em>feather</em> in the <em>wound.</em> We found a
<em>fiber</em> which appears to be <em>from</em> a feather.”</p>
<p>“Crow?”</p>
<p>“<em>Corvus corax principalis,</em> quite common in these parts.”</p>
<p>“Jerry thought it was from a different bird?”</p>
<p>“Jerry saw a picture in a book of a bird that doesn't even exist on
this <em>continent</em> and immediately jumped to the conclusion that our
bird couldn't be a common crow, but had to be some exotic species that
had flown here across the atlantic ocean. Which is <em>exactly</em> what I'm
talking about. It's a fiber from a crow feather. It's not from an
albatross or a phoenix or a dragon. Frankely, I wonder if he really
wants to catch this killer or if he's deliberately trying to muddle the
facts!”</p>
<p>“Calm down,” said Cold. He didn't like the way that was headed.</p>
<p>“I'm not saying anything. I just wonder if, well, it's a small town
and since we broke in to the house, practically the whole town is
involved. <em>Somebody</em> has to be the killer, and <em>everybody's</em> helping
out.”</p>
<p>“I said calm down.”</p>
<p>“I'm not saying… of course you're going to catch the killer. They
say you already know who the killer is, you know. People about town. I
mean, I don't doubt that you're close. You'd have told me if you had
a definite subject… er… suspect. Of course you would. But I mean,
<em>where</em> is the objectivity?”</p>
<p>“Who says I already know who the killer is?” said Cold, and then
berated himself for letting himself be led off topic.</p>
<p>Mr. Scroter waved his hand in a vague way, but then stopped abruptly.
“Tiffany Hamm, I seem to recall.  Do you know her?”</p>
<p>Cold made a noise.  It was a small town, but not small enough that
everybody could be expected to know everybody.  It just so happened
that he <em>did</em> know Tiffany Hamm, who worked at the Wal-Mart just
out of town and had been in his drunk tank once, just after her prom
six years ago.  She had been been attending classes at a university
for a while, but didn't seem to be doing that anymore as far as Cold
could tell.</p>
<p>“What difference does the species of crow make?” asked Cold, trying
to bring the conversation back.</p>
<p>“Probably nothing. It's a crow feather.  It might be a crow that is
known to inhabit this area, or it might be a magical crow from beyond
the sea.  Either way, it probably doesn't mean anything.”</p>
<p>“Let me know if anything else turns up that seems…” Cold got up and
started to put his impermeable back on as he thought for the word.</p>
<p>“…magical.”</p>
