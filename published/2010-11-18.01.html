<h1>Chapter 2010-11-18 - 1</h1>
<p>Cold looked at the photographs of the document.  Mr. Scroter had said that it had been written in
blood and Jerry the Coroner had confirmed it.  He had even been able to take samples and
match the blood in the later chapters with those of the three bodies.  The earlier chapters,
however, were not a match.  There seemed to be three additional people represented in that
book, though Jerry said that those samples were quite old, nearly twenty years.</p>
<p>The document itself seemed to be some sort of fairy tale or myth about gods and godesses.
Or anyway, it started out that way.  It never really resolved itself and, as it went on,
it seemed to become more and more of a paeon to one god in particular.  The author seemed
to become obsessed with offering gifts to this god, and Cold didn't have to use his
imagination to figure out what gifts the author had thought appropriate.</p>
<p>The mason jars turned out each one to contain a smaller container.  Some had glass bottles,
others double-lined plastic zip lock bags.  These contained blood.  The blood in the glass
jars was a crumbling dried mass, but the blood in the bags was fresh.</p>
<p>The date range of the blood samples meant that either he was dealing with someone older
than himself, or he was dealing with more than one killer.  There were slight differences
in the handwriting, too, but Cold couldn't be sure whether it was because a second author
was attempting to match the handwriting of the first, or if it was that the author's handwriting
had changed in the intervening decades.  Either way, it was a florid script full of sweeping,
old fashioned flourishes.  It was a very carefully studied handwriting, not a natural hand.</p>
<p>Cold slipped the photographs back into their envelope.  It was draining to read this stuff,
knowing what it was.  He pushed his chair back and staired at the ceiling of the interview
room.</p>
<p>The interview room was quiet. It was a good place to think.  It was the only place to think.
Since he had oncovered the secret study, he had become a town hero.  He had always had a
reputation for methodical reliability, but he was shocked at how many people jumped on
board enthousiastically when he had announced his illogical waste of resources, turning
over the old Bart house.  People had expected him to turn up the goods and, to his utter
surprise, he had.  There had been nothing logical about that decision, but no one knew
that but him, not even Alice.</p>
<p>The truth was that the house had just… bothered him.  He wanted to expose it, to get it
out of his head.  But in a way, it had had the opposite effect.  Now it was clear that
whatever was going on, it was going on in that house.</p>
<p>Cold felt that he was no closer to discovering the identity of the killer or killers.
On the contrary, his new celebrity status meant that he had no time to think about
things.  People were now so eager to help, they wouldn't let him have a moment's meditation.</p>
<p>Just then, there was a knock at the door.  It was officer Mitchel.  Cold sighed a sigh that rumbled
and went to see what she wanted.</p>
<p>“Local TV statsion's sent over someone to interview you,” she said, “what should I tell them?”</p>
<p>“That we haven't caught the guy yet.  Is Jerry here?”</p>
<p>“No, I haven't see… wait, he just walked in.  Jerry!”</p>
<p>A woman and a man with a camera on his shoulder came running up and tried to talk with Cold.
Cold suddenly felt very trapped in the room.  He pushed past the camera crew and found Jerry.
The reporter wheeled around and came at him with a microphone.</p>
<p>“No comment,” he said, putting his hand over the microphone.  He grabbed Jerry by the arm
and took him outside.  The reporter and the cameraman followed.</p>
<p>“No comment,” repeated Cold as he dragged Jerry down the street.  Bill Miller from the deli
stopped him and patted him on the shoulder.</p>
<p>“Way to go, Columbo!” he said loudly.  Cold made a noise and moved on, Jerry in tow.  The reporter
followed along for half a block, but Cold's pace was too brisk for her cameraman to match with his
heavy equipment and they soon fell back.</p>
<p>Cold and Jerry entered a diner and started to look for a seat, but every eye in the place was on 
them, so Cold turned and walked out again.</p>
<p>Back on the street, he looked right and left like a fugitive looking for a place to hide.</p>
<p>“The cemetery,” said the coroner and Cold started off briskly in that direction without a word.
They dodged several more enthousiastic fans before they got to the iron gates of the cemetery.
Inside, it was peaceful and quiet as it should be.  There was no one about.</p>
<p>“I come here when I need to think,” said the Coroner.  “Nobody here but old friends who know
when to shut up.”</p>
<p>Cold slackened his pace when they were out of site of the gates among the grassy hills and
whispering trees.</p>
<p>“Any luck with the pen?” he asked.</p>
<p>“No, well yes.”</p>
<p>Cold waited.</p>
<p>“Jim was wrong about the species, but he won't admit it.”</p>
<p>“Jim?”</p>
<p>“Scroter.  He said it was a <em>Corvus corax principalis,</em> which is common around here.  But I don't
think so.  It is similar, but it didn't match the descriptions in the books.  Looks more like a
<em>subcorax</em> to me.”</p>
<p>“That it?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but he—that man—boy he doesn't like to be wrong.  Must be working with all those uppity
kids.  Practically jumped down my throat about how it was a <em>Corvus corax principalis</em> and nothing
else.  I'm like ‘Dude, I'm a scientist, too!  In fact, I'm a scientist and you're a science teacher,’
I didn't say that last thing, but I could have.  He kinda went ape shit about the whole thing.”</p>
<p>“I don't know what you're saying.”</p>
<p>“The fiber we found in the wound.  We thought it was one kind of raven, but I think it's a different
kind.  Scroter's having a hissy fit about it.  Kept going on about how it couldn't be a <em>subcorax</em>.
That woudld be impossible.”</p>
<p>“Does it make a difference?”</p>
<p>“Well, it's not professional.”</p>
<p>“I mean to the case.”</p>
<p>“Don't see how.”</p>
<p>“You find anything in the book?”</p>
<p>“Nah, Scroter's looking at that.  My thing is bodies.”</p>
<p>“Have a look.”</p>
