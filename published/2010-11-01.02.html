<h1>Chapter 2010-11-01 - 2</h1>
<h2>Sheriff Cold Finds a Body</h2>
<p>Sheriff Cold found the body of the girl lying in the road
in front of the Colonel's house.  He pursed his lips so his
mustache bristled and he sighed a sigh that rumbled.  He left
the girl there and went up to the house.  Signs of a struggle?
Who knows.  The old house had been unlived in for decades.</p>
<p>Graffitti covered the walls.  Windows were broken.  Here and
there scorch marks on the floor showed where indoor bonfires
had been lit and—by the work of some miracle—had not burned
the old house down.  There an abandoned sleeping bag, there
a stained mattress.  There a broken bottle of Jack.  Shame about
the Jack.</p>
<p>Sheriff Cold made his way upstairs.  The upper rooms were not
disturbed.  No one went to the upper rooms to romp and play.
Sheriff Cold knew why.  It was colder there.  No matter the weather,
the second floor was always colder.  The first floor was cool in
the summer's heat, but the second floor was ice cold in August
and ice cold in February.</p>
<p>A curtain hung in an open window and
waved at him in a sultry way.  It was the wrong window, though.
Faced the side of the house, not the front.  The window he was
looking for was in the attic.  Sheriff Cold had never been to the
attic, not as a boy, not as a man.  Sheriff Cold had never heard
of anyone going to the attic.  No one had ever been past the second
floor of old Bart's mansion.</p>
<p>Sheriff Cold found the stairs and started to climb.  The stairs
squawked under his boots.  Each one said “Cold!” when he put his
foot on it.  Each one said “Hear!” when he lifted his foot.  Said
it in a woman's voice.  Or a girl's.</p>
<p>Half-way up the stairs, Sheriff Cold had to stop and catch his breath.
The stairs were speaking in his sister's voice.  By God! It was freezing
on those steps.  They were slick with frost.  Sheriff Cold looked back
down to the second floor.  He sighed a sigh that rumbled and his ghost
floated in front of his eyes for a moment.  Then he looked up toward the
top of the steps and started again.  One. Step. At. A. Time.  Saying his
name with each footfall.  Saying it in his sister's voice.  Penny's voice.
Lost to him these twenty years.  “Cold!” She said, “Hear!” She said.</p>
<p>In the attic, Sheriff Cold found what he expected to find.  An empty
room.  Dusty floor boards.  Footsteps.  A chair.  A window.  Footsteps
lead to the chair.  If he looked out the window, he would see the girl's
body in the road.  He looked.  He saw.  He suddenly felt a sharp wave of
vertigo and clutched the sash.  He felt his weight roll over the sash.
Felt the gravity of the road pulling him out the window. Felt the
inevitability of the Earth below him, pulling him to it.  Felt the pain.
He fought it for a moment, then let go.  He let go of the window sash and
fell...</p>
<p>...to the floor of the attic.</p>
<p>A cloud of dust had risen around him.  He coughed and heard his cough
echo against the empty walls and naked rafters.  Suddenly, the attic
was just a room.  He was in it.  He was in the world.  Making heat.
Coughing.  Hurting.  Damn!  He had hit his chin on the sash when he fell
and was bleeding.  Drops of his blood fell into the dust, into the spoiled
footprints.</p>
<p>Sheriff Cold glanced at the window again, but did not look out of it.
There was some blood on the sill.</p>
<p>He went back down the stairs, which only creaked.  He went out of the
house as the morgue wagon was pulling up the windy road to claim the
body of the girl.  He went back to his station to make his report.</p>
