<h1>Chapter 2010-11-27 - 2</h1>
<p>The door of Mr. Scroter's apartment swung open with a crash and rebounded against
the wall to strike Officer Mitchell's still outstretched boot and stop.  She hadn't expected the
cheap lock to break so easily.  She and officer Gibson burst in with their pistols in
their hands.</p>
<p>Scroter's house was neat and clean.  First they checked every room carefully to determine
that the flat was, indeed, empty.  Then they began to look for papers.</p>
<p>“For a teacher, this guy sure doesn't like paperwork,” said Officer Gibson.</p>
<p>Mitchell made a noise.  They could not find a file cabinet anywhere.  No stack of bills, no
journals, no notebooks.  There was nothing that would have had Scroter's handwriting on
it.</p>
<p>“How does he grade papers?” asked Gibson.</p>
<p>“Cold?” said Mitchell into the cell phone she had left connected to Cold at the High School.
“There's nothing here.  Not even school papers to be graded.”</p>
<p>“Hold on,” said Cold.  There was muffled talking on the phone as Mitchell and Gibson continued
to open cupboards and look for papers.</p>
<p>“Electronic,” said Cold after a moment.  “Principal says the classroom's gone paperless. All
assignments submitted to the school's website.”</p>
<p>“Hey!” shouted a man at the door who nearly had his head shot off by the nervous officers.</p>
<p>“Who are you?” asked Mitchell.</p>
<p>“I'm Frank! I'm the super.  What's going on here?”</p>
<p>Gibson showed the super the fax of the search warrant.</p>
<p>“What is this about? Is Mr. Scroter in trouble? I never had any problem with him.  He always paid
his rent on time, never made any noise.”</p>
<p>“How?” asked a tinny voice over Officer Mitchell's cell phone.</p>
<p>“What?” asked Mitchell.</p>
<p>“How did he pay the rent?”</p>
<p>The super looked confused.  “He dropped off a check in my box once a…”</p>
<p>Mitchell and Gibson nearly jumped on the man.  The nervous super nearly bolted down the hall, but
Mitchell backed off.</p>
<p>“Could you very kindly show us a copy of one of Mr.
Scroter's checks?”</p>
<p>“Why?  What's this about?  I don't have to show you anything. Do I?”</p>
<p>“No you don't Frank,” said Mitchell, “our warrant only covers this apartment.”</p>
<p>“Well, when you get a warrant for my apartment, I'll show you my records.”</p>
<p>“You son of a…” began Gibson.  Mitchell gave him a silencing frown.</p>
<p>“Frank, we're looking for examples of Mr. Scroter's handwriting.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“We think he might be involved in the murders.”</p>
<p>“Murders?” asked Frank, blanching.</p>
<p>“Yes, we'd like to compare his handwriting to some samples we found in the Bart
mansion.”</p>
<p>“You only need to see one check?”</p>
<p>“Just one,” said Mitchell.</p>
<p>“Wait right here,” said the super and he disappeared like a rat down a hole.</p>
<p>“What's his problem?” asked Gibson.</p>
<p>“He takes a five percent cut the building owner doesn't know about,” said Cold's electronic
voice over the speaker.</p>
<p>“You know about it?” asked Mitchell with surprise.</p>
<p>“He's got a son in Iraq and he keeps the building clean.  Paid for a fumigator himself last
year when the owner wouldn't.”</p>
<p>“<em>How</em> do you know this,” asked Gibson, but then the super came back with a piece of paper
in his hand.  It was a photocopy of a check, ripped hastily from a bank statement.  Gibson
pulled out a folded wad of photocopies of his own and opened it up.  Mitchell looked over
his shoulder at the two papers.<br />
</p>
<p>In the “pay to the order of” line, he had written in his usual blocky printed letters, which
thanks to Wikipedia, Mitchell and Gibson now knew was modeled after a medeaval “uncial” hand.
But where the dollar amount had to be spelled out in cursive, he had used a florid, flowing
hand that would not have looked out of place at the bottom of the Declaration of Independence.</p>
<p>“Look at this ‘s’ here in the word ‘seventy,’ that looks like an ‘f.’” said Gibson, “He uses the same
stroke here in the journal in the word ‘Proserpina.’”</p>
<p>“Look at the way he switches the stem of his ‘d’ back in ‘Hades’ like a Greek delta.  See there
in ‘dollars,’ he does the same thing.”</p>
<p>“Do you have any idea where he might have gone, Frank,” said Gibson.</p>
<p>“No.  No idea.”</p>
<p>“I have one,” said Cold over the phone.</p>
