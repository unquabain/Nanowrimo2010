# Chapter 2010-11-10 - 4

That wicked Puck, the killer struck:  
The two-fold deed was done.  
Although in death, when life and breath  
And warming touch have gone,  
There still remains a font of pains  
For Love has lingered on,  
In darkened nooks and sonnet books  
In Nowhere, Oregon.  

Whatever his name was, thought the tramp, it was not fucking John Keats.

In the other room, Alice hung up the phone.  She came into the living room
where the tramp was working out his *Ballad of Nowhere, Oregon* on the old
guitar around a fluorescent table lamp.

“Well, that was Cold.  He says you can go.”

“I can go?”

“Yep.  Seems there's been another murder while you were here with me, so
it couldn't have been you.”

“Another murder? Fuck!”

“I know.  It's terrible.”

“My whole song was about lovers who died together.  Now there's three.”

“Well, there's that, too.”

“I'm going to have to trash the whole thing and start over!”

“Well. In that case...”

“What?”

“Oregon rhymes with ‘bun,’ not with ‘gone.’  It's not a *shape!*”

“Right.  Who was he?”

“Oh, I didn't know him. He was a salesman, sounds like.  Made calls to people from
his house trying to sell them condos or steak knives I guess.  I suppose somebody
has to do that.”

“Yeah.”

“Look.  You're free to go, but do you *have* anywhere to go?”

“Oh sure.  San Francisco!  I was headed there.”

“Well it's kinda late to be going to San Francisco.  Do you have somewhere to
go tonight?”

“Oh sure.  I'll just head down to the cemeter…”

“Don't tell me that! I'm the Sheriff's wife!  I can't know that you're going there!
You *could* stay in the guest room.  It's not made up, but I can put it together
pretty quick if you'd like.”

“Oh, you don't need to do that!”

“Sure I do.  It's Christian.”

“Ha! I mean you don't have to make it up.  It'll be like a four star hotel to me.”

“It's settled then.  I did like your song.  Maybe it doesn't have to be about those
kids.  Maybe it's just a song.”

“It was a lousy song anyway.”

“No it wasn't!”

“Yes it was.”

“Yes it was.  But I'm sure you were going to make it better!”

The tramp smiled.

“Sure.”
