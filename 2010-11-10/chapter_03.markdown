# Chapter 2010-11-10 - 3

Knowing now how to revive herself in the creek, Sonja grew day by day
bolder and ventured further and further down the valley to the cold
creek that ran at the bottom of it. She wondered if, somehow, this was
the same creek that ran through her ball room. Did it meander round,
down the hill and wind up there? She followed the creek every day, going
a little further, taking a new turn, staying close to the water in case
her asthma came back.

The whisperers still waited on her in the castle and the gardens, but
they didn't follow her on these trips. It was perhaps that they knew she
wanted to be alone. Or perhaps they did not like the woods on the other
side of the creek.

One day, she reached was walking along the stream through a vinyard and
came to a large mound of rock. The stream passed under the rock and she
could not see where it went. So she hiked her dress up around her knees
and climbed up and over the rock.

On the far side, she was astonished to see the ground drop away
precipitously and a bright waterfall flowing from the rock. She
carefully climbed down into the little grotto that the water had
worn away. There was a pool at the bottom with large gold and red
fish swimming about. Their feathery fins looked trailed in the water
and their scales flashed like coins. Their big, black eyes looked
intelligently up at her. They seemed almost to stroke their whiskers and
say “Ah so. It is you. You appear to be not so fair, yet not so plain.
I see that you are not so clever, but neither are you so dull. You are
appropriate.”

She reached her hand into the perfectly clear, cold water and reached
for one of the fish, which did not swim away from her.

Suddenly, there was an enormous explosion. Something huge dropped into
the water and doused her completely.

“Ah!” she cried and backed away. There, on the other side of the
stream, was the huge bear. It had swatted the fish out of the water and
had it on the bank, tearing open its stomach with its enormous, sharp
teeth.

With horror, Sonja saw that the black eyes of the fish seemed to look at
her saying “Is this what I am? Is this what my years add up to? These
teeth! I have been a fish.”

When the bear had finished devouring the fish, it turned to Sonja and
said “this is not the place for you, Fish. Go back to your castle on
the hill. Don't you like it there? Are you not pleased?”

“I like it there very much.”

“Then why do you return to my forest?”

“I… I suppose I am curious.”

“I am a bear. This is a forest. What is there to be curous about?”

“I am curious about me? Why can I breathe only underwater?”

“Because you are a fish, Fish.”

“I do not feel that I am a fish. Why do coffee and wine make my yearn?
Why can I not name what it is I yearn for?”

“How dare you yearn! Has not your husband provided everything for
you?”

“My husband? I suppose that he has. I simply want to know.”

“Malcontent! You will swim away! You will leave him broken-hearted and
his castle will crumble. I should eat you now before you can destroy
him, Fish!”

“I don't want to swim away! I like it in the castle! I do!”

“Come here, Fish, that I may tear your stomach.”

Sonja almost did.  The command was so fierce and raw, that Sonja almost
wanted to obey it.  

She turned to run, but she realized that she
was cornered in the grotto.  The only way to escape was to climb
straight upward.  The bear opened her mouth and let out a tremendous
roar.  It shook Sonja's bowels and nearly loosed them.  She clung
to the damp, wet rocks.  The bear swiped one of its enormous paws at
her.  The long claws were like knives and would have ripped her stomach
open if they were but a bit longer.  Sonja imagined having her stomach
ripped open like the fish's.  Would she bleed red, or would she be filled
with tender white meat?

“Come, Fish! I said come here and be devoured!” and the bear gave another
roar, and Sonja felt an itching urge to be devoured.  How exciting it would
be to have those teeth rend her flesh, to have her spine snapped and then…
and then oblivion.  But not exactly oblivion, because then she would be a
part of this bear!  She would be not just Sonja alone, not too plain,
not too dull.  She would be blood flowing through the veins, force in the
muscles, strength in the bones of this huge Power!

Once more, the bear roared and Sonja's knees quaked.  She hugged herself
and electric sparks flew up her spine from the small of her back.  She
bit her lip. God!—she wanted to be eaten by a bear!  She wanted to flee
from a bear!

Sonja, through her terror, realized that the bear could not
cross the stream to get her.  So carefully, slowly, Sonja turned her
back on the bear—who roared her anger and frustration—and she began to
climb.  Every inch she raised herself, she imagined sharp claws slicing
through her back.  Every time she lifted her legs to find a new foot-hold,
she thought of the soft white flesh of her belly being turned out into
the sun.

At last, she was at the top of the waterfall and she looked over her
shoulder at the bear standing by the pool at the bottom.  One last time,
she imagined herself letting go of the rock and falling in an extasy and
breaking upon those rocks.  She pulled herself over the rocks and could
see the bear no longer.

She ran back up the stream to her castle, hearing the bear roar in the
distance and each time feeling a weekness in the knees that was at once
fear and longing.

And then she was in the castle and the door was closed behind her and she
could hear the bear no longer.

She ripped off her clothes and dived into the stream, to feel the cold
water run over her body, to numb her legs, to cool her head.  She stayed
in the stream the rest of the afternoon.

*****

That night, when the man came to bed and stripped naked and lay down
beside her, he said: “You have angered the bear today.”

“Yes,” said Sonja.

The man was silent again.  It was the first time Sonja had heard him
speak and wondered if he were now done.

But after a long silence, he said “The bear can afford to be angered.
She, too, has things to learn.”

Sonja said nothing.

“Do not anger the bear again!” said the man sternly.

“I won't,” said Sonja, who honestly and from the deepest part of her
heart had no desire to anger the bear again.  But she added “Are you
my husband?”

He turned to look at her.  In the dark, she could see the curve of his
cheekbone and the reflection in the wetness of his eye.  She thought
perhaps she could see a shadow where the curve of his lip might be.

“Who are you?” he asked, as if he was suddenly surprised to see her
in his bed.

“Where you are Gaius,” Sonja said, although she didn't know why, “I
am Gaia.”

The man, the enormous man, raised himself up and rolled over so that he
was supported by his arms on either side of Sonja's head. She looked up
at him, though she still could not see his face. His scent filled her
nose and head, and she closed her eyes. He lowered his head and kissed
her forehead. Then he kissed her cheek. And he rumbled from somewhere
deep in his throat, in his chest. And Sonja felt an itching urge to be
devoured. Then he kissed her lips and electric sparks flew up her spine
from the small of her back.  She felt his penis hard against the soft,
white flesh of her belly, and she put her arms around him.
