# Chapter 2010-11-14 - 1

The tramp started down the path, listening to the birds and rising and
falling churn of cicadas. He noticed a thin steam rising from his damp
clothes. He took his jacket off and hung it on a nearby steak fence. He
began to whistle to himself as he walked.

As he walked, he became more interested in the bare footprints he saw
in the dust. This was clearly a vinyard, and a large one, but he didn't
see any evidence of tractor treads in the dust, or boot prints or wagon
wheels. Glancing back at the house, he didn't see any tools. There were
always tools left out on farms. He decided that all the crazy rain must
have washed the older prints and traces away, even the deep tractor
tread marks.

He was no tracker and tried not to think too much about things he had
no business or experience thinking about. Songs, stories, that were his
trade. Meters and rhymes were his spade and axe. So he kept his whistle
tune happy and his steps lively. But he couldn't stop thinking about how
many sets of barefoot prints he saw down every path he ventured. His own
worn hight-top treads massive and mechanical seeming alongside those
smaller prints. And he couldn't stop himself from thinking that it must
have taken quite a while to accumulate that many tracks on that many
lanes. Surely they couldn't have all been made since some recent heavy
rainfall. Also, he didn't see any evidence of recent rains here, not
that he knew what to look for other than puddles.

So what made sense? Surely not walking through a door and finding
another country inside. But never mind that. This was an orphanage, and
the older children worked the fields producing wine… no, can't make
children make wine. A convent, then. Barefoot nuns running about picking
grapes, pressing them with bare feet. Sheltered young women living
together away from the influence of any men, living an idyllic and
chaste life until a tramp from anther world suddenly shows up in their
midst with a wide open smile singing songs of the world with its dangers
and heros…

Stop there, whatever your name is. Calm down, now. This is not that kind
of song. Unless it is, but it's probably not.

Why couldn't it be that kind of song? Hell, what kind of song *is* it?

He changed the tune that he was whistling. No one need know what all the
raunchy words were if he just whistled. Oddly, that seemed to reign in
his wayword thoughts, though then he was free to realize that he hadn't
solved anything.

And then he heard something that thrust thoughts of Sir Galahad at the
Castle Anthrax out of his head for good. It sounded like a woman's cry
of distress. He ran toward the sound.

After a bit, he stopped. He didn't know if he was running in the right
direction. He stopped to listen. There it was. Only it might not have
been a woman. It might have been some sort of animal. He ran toward it.
Whatever she or it was, it sounded like it was in distress.

He ran ahead and stopped to listed, heard it, chose a direction and
ran. After repeating this a few more times, he came to a shaded copse
at the bottom of the vinyard by the margin of the forest. Then he heard
something entirely different. It sounded like a lion's roar! It was so
loud and near, the strength nearly left his knees, but he managed to
half-run, half-fall toward the copse and the noise. The roar came again
and he had to force himself to move forward through a thick congealed of
trembling fear that seemed to have replaced the summer air.

He darted into the copse and saw, not a lion, but an enormous bear!
It looked directly at him and roared again, jaws opening wide enough
to hold his whole head and part of someone else's besides. He started
to back out of the copse when he saw something in the creek that ran
between the bear and himself. It looked like a large fish, too large for
this little creek. He paused in his retreat, partly out of curiosity
and partly, in all honesty, because he needed his butt muscles just
then to back up his sphincter, which was attempting to be helpful by
jettisoning excess cargo in case he had to run. The bear roared again.
The tramp closed his eyes and clenched his muscles. He let the rumbling
fear pour over him. When he opened his eyes again, he saw something
quite different in the water. It was a woman! Her head was under the
water and she didn't seem to be moving. The bear was standing over her.

That tramp had done much in his life of which he was not proud, but
in that moment something else in him stood up and stepped forward. He
snatched up a large branch from the ground and hoisted it in front of
him. Filling his lungs to the very bottom with air, he used his well
exercised diaphragm and vocal chords to emit the loudest, most fearsome
cry he could manage. It would have been impressive in a crowd in the
city, but it was a weak and impotent next to the bear's thundering roar.
Nevertheless, he used it to launch himself toward the bear, swinging
the hefty stick back and forth as he ran. He thrust the branch into the
bear's face and started to beat it about the head. The bear swatted at
the branch. The tramp managed to fend off the first swat and get in a
few more licks before the bear swatted it again and knocked the branch
from his hands and him to the ground in the process. Now he was on his
knees and the bear towered over him. Only the stream separated that,
and the bear's head and arm reached easily over that meagre border. It
raised its paw to strike his head from his shoulders. He punched it
squarely in the nose. The bear recoiled. The tramp used the opportunity
to grab the branch again and get to his feet. The bear reached up to
swat the branch again, but the tramp thrust it into the bears eyes. The
bear turned its head to avoid getting struck in the eyes. It swatted at
the branch, but the tramp managed to dodge the paw again and hit the
bear in the head. The bear retreated a few steps and regarded the tramp
for a few moments. He stood over the body of the woman in the water,
legs apart, swinging his branch at the bear. The bear gave him another
roar that the tramp could feel roll in his lungs, in his stomach. Then
it turned and sulked off. The tramp stood still over the body until the
bear, turning once more to give him a scornfull look, vanished into the
wood.

Then the tramp tossed the branch to the side and dove into the stream.
He grabbed the woman by the arms and pulled her from the water. He
expected her to be unconscious. He handn't been thinking about how well
he could remember the CPR he had seen performed on TV and how accurate
it might have been. But when he got her onto dry land, he was surprised
to see her eyes open, regarding him in puzzlement. Then she rolled onto
her side and she coughed up water.

Then the tramp saw the most extraordinary thing he had ever seen in his
life. Now he understood why at first he had thought there was a large
fish in the water. She was a mermaid! She was a woman from the waist
up, but where her hips should have been, there were shining scales and
delicate fins like ruffles of silk. As he watched, the scales began to
grow dull and to pucker. They fell off onto the dirt, and then her skin
split and fell away in fleshy chunks. As if in a time-lapse movie, the
chunks liquified and shrank away, running in silver rivulets into the
water, where they disolved and were carried away by the current.

Then there was just the tramp and a naked woman in the middle of the
woods. Shame suddenly took hold of him, and he looked about furtively
to see if anyone was looking. He spied a dirty, bloody dress nearby. He
reached for it, thinking he could use it to wrap up the woman in her
nudity, when all of a sudden she struck him.

She launched herself at him and threw him to the ground. Then, lustily,
she jumped on top of him and straddled him. His head struck a rock and
he saw stars. Before he could clear his head, she ripped his shirt open.
She thrust her head down and licked his chest. “The Fuck?” said
the tramp, and then she bit him. The brief re-appearance of the Castle
Anthrax into his imagination ended just as quickly. She bit *hard* and
drew blood. He tried to push her off, but she fought back. She bit him
again and again with surprisingly sharp teeth. She was strong and fast
and she kept biting him.  Her fingernails were sharp as claws and blood
began to flow from her scratches as well.  Everywhere, there was flurry
of bloody fingers as he tried to beat her away and push her head from his
chest.  Finally, he managed to get his hands on either side of her head
and, with her fingernails embedded into his forearms, he lifted her head
with difficulty from his chest.  His blood covered her mouth and chin
like a beard.  Her eyes were wild and trembled in their sockets.  She
looked at him and grinned with bloody red gums.

And then a different expression took over her face.  She suddenly looked
afraid.  She pulled herself off of him, stood up and ran.  The tramp didn't
have enough strength in his head to watch where she went.  He dropped his
head back to the ground and watched the stars in his head multiply until it
was night.
