NANOWRIMO 2010
==============
This is my NaNoWriMo for 2010.

I am going to write it in Markdown this year instead of in LaTeX and see
how that goes.

Latest wordcount: 45362 (100.97% @ 2010-11-27T22:56:38.432531)

## How to read it.

There are folders marked with the date (in `YYYY-MM-DD` format so they will sort correctly).
Within each of these folders, there are files marked `chapter_XX.markdown` that are the chapters.
Read these in order.

Alternatively, you can use the **Downloads** link above to download a compressed archive of the
whole source.  In the source, you'll see a `published` directory with rendered HTML files.
