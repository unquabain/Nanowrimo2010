# Chapter 2010-11-25 - 3

Sonja spent the day in tears.  The whispering voices were closer
than ever and seemed anxious that they couldn't bring her anything
that would solve her problem.

The tramp had been cruel and unwise. He should not have insulted
her husband, the god, in his own house. The tramp would and should
be eaten by the bear of the forest. It was just what he deserved.
But he was the closest thing to a friend that she could remember
ever having.

And the things he had said buzzed and rung inside her head. Why
couldn't she remember ever having any friends?  Why couldn't she
remember growing up? She knew what a computer was and a cell phone,
but she couldn't remember ever seeing them except for the ones she
found in the office when he told her to look for them.

He had said that she didn't belong here. Well how could that be when
everything she ever wished for was brought to her instantly? This was
her home and everything about it was created just for her.

On the other hand, how could she belong here when she couldn't even
breathe the air for a whole day at a time? And what happened to her?
Was it strange enough that she grew a tail whenever she felt the cold
water of the stream flow over her? Those marks on the tramps chest.
She had given them to him.  She didn't remember giving them to him, but
when she saw them, she knew she had.  What was worse, she felt the desire
to make more of them.  To tear the muscles out of his chest with her
sharp teeth and expose his white bones.  She wanted to tear him open
as the bear had torn open that fish.

How could that be her?

She was so confused.

When night fell and it was time to go to bed, she went instead down
every corridor, every strange, small passage she could find.  Every
hallway she turned down seemed to lead to another, smaller, darker one.

She went from brighly lit grand halls to narrow, torch-lit dungeon
passageways, to candle-lit channels between the walls.  Then she found
a small door, a cupboard set at floor-height into one damp, dark cold
wall.  She knelt down and crawled inside.  She closed the door after
her and sat for a time, knees tucked between her chin, in the cramped,
pitch-black space.

“Whisperers,” she whispered.  “I need a light.  A very small light that
I can keep in the palm of my hand.  Something that is easy to hide.”

She became aware after a while that there was already something in her
hand.  Something metal that was beginning to warm to her touch.  She found
a soft bubble on its side and pressed it.  Her hand lit up with a bloody
red light as the small flashlight shone through her flesh.

Sonja opened the cupboard and crawled out.  Slowly, guiltily, she retraced
her steps back into the bright and comfortable rooms of the house, the
small flashlight in her palm.

She dressed for bed and slid the light under her pillow.  Then she lay
on her bed and waited.

After a while, she heard familiar footsteps coming down the hallway.
The door opened, and in came her husband, her God.  He came and sat
on the end of the bed, then he lay next to her and kissed her forehead.
Then he kissed her mouth.

Sonja felt ashamed of what she had been planning to do, and she wrapped
her arms around him.  They made love silently in the darkened room and,
when it was done, he lay next to her with his head in the pit between
her shoulder and her neck and his enormous arm draped across her stomach.
Then he began to breathe softly and deeply.  Soon, Sonja knew he was
asleep.

But Sonja couldn't sleep.  She had made up her mind not to use the light.
There was the tramp and there was her husband. The tramp was just a tramp
with a guitar.  Her husband was a god! There could be no comparison between
them.  There could be no challenge to her loyalty.  The tramp had failed.
She would be sorry to see him eaten, but she would not betray her husband
for him.

But Sonja was a different matter. No, she wouldn't use the flashlight for
the tramp. But didn't she desire to know what her husband looked like?
Shouldn't that be her right as a wife? Wasn't it absurd that she didn't
know? Didn't even know his name.  Like the tramp, she didn't even know
her own full name.

And who said it was a betrayal, anyway? He hadn't ever told her not to
bring a light into the bedroom.  He hadn't said “Don't ever look at me,
I command you.” He hadn't ever, in fact, told her not to do anything. This
house he had made for her was designed to give her anything she wanted.
What if she wanted this? Wouldn't it be his will that she have it?

And then the thought struck her.  What if he were a bear?  That was absurd,
of course. He was her husband, and they had made love and she had felt him
above her and beside her and inside her. Clearly, he was no bear!

But he was really, really big.

She shuddered at the thought of lying with a bear. It repulsed her.  Not
a bear, then.

But she had to see.

She gently removed his arm from her stomach and pulled out the flashlight.
As she moved, the more she left the warm comfort of his sleeping embrace,
the more guilty she felt.  He hadn't said that she shouldn't do this. But
he hadn't needed to. There were things she understood from being near him,
from smelling him, from being his.  There were things that she must not
do, and this was one of them.

At the same time, this was something that she must do.

She brought up the flashlight and put her thumb on the rubber knob that 
covered the switch.  She stood on her knees on the edge of the giant bed,
naked and growing cold.

For a moment before she pressed the switch, she saw the form of a giant
bear lying there on the bed, its muzzle long, its hair matted with sweat.
She had a convulsion of fear and she jabbed her thumb onto the switch as
hard as she could as if she could make it brighter by striking the switch
with more force.

And indeed, it seemed that the room burst into dazzling light from every
direction.  Every surface of the room seemed to be incandescent and
sparkling. And in the middle of the room, bathed in the shadowless light,
was the most beautiful man she had ever seen.

His shoulders were round and muscular, his lips full and curved. His
eyelashes were long, his eyebrows high and arched.  His hair was dark
and fell across his pillow in long, graceful ringlets.

He opened his eyes and lifted himself onto one arm.  He looked at Sonja,
and his expression was one of infinite sadness.

As she looked into his soft, brown eyes, almost the color of burgundy,
her heart burst in her chest because she knew what she had done.

He reached out and cupped her cheek and one bright tear dropped from
his eye and landed on the bedsheet.

“I will love you still, from North of the Sky,” he said.  And then
the light dwindled and coalesced into spots, which shrank and receded
until Sonja realized that she was looking at the stars in the night sky.

She was naked, on a rock on top of a hill.  Amid the dark
splotches of moss at her knees, something bright.  Where his tear had
fallen, something small.  She picked it up and felt its hard, sharp edges.
She saw the way it echoed and replied to the starlight and knew it was
a diamond.
