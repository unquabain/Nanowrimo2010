# Chapter 2010-11-25 - 2

The house shook under Penny's feet.  The wind blew at the
windows in a way that it hadn't in… she had forgotton how
long ago it was.

She looked at Colonel Bart and the other man.  The other man
didn't notice, but Colonel Bart was stroking his mustache.
Colonel Bart never looked worried, but he also never stroked
his mustache.  Colonel Bart was not a man who changed.

Penny looked out the window at the rain.  The wind was blowing
at the windows, trying to blow them in.

“Strong house,” said Colonel Bart, and Penny knew that it was
true.  She had tried to open those windows many times and failed.

Only once had she succeeded.

Only once.

The other man was lighting candles.  Black candles.  Who has black
candles? Isn't the point of a candle to make light?  Why have a black
candle?

Penny stood in front of the man as he walked from corner to corner,
preparing the attic for the ritual.  The man side-stepped her casually,
without looking at her.  Penny was never quite sure if it was because
he detested her or because he didn't really know she was there.

The wind blew again.  Penny looked out the window at the road winding
through the false cedars.  Someone was coming.  He was dark and he wore
a dark coat and he was clutching a bundle.

“Someone's coming,” said Penny.

“Indeed,” said the Colonel.

“Someone's coming,” said the man, as if he had thought of it.

Soon, there was a knock at the door. Penny went to the door to watch
the man answer it.  She could feel the door as she approached it. She
could feel the repelling force of it.  It got stronger as she got nearer
to it.  She could go right up to the door, but she could never go through
it.  The house wanted her.  Colonel Bart wanted her.  That man, whoever
he was, wanted her to be here.

The man opened the door and let the second man in.  The wind had torn
at his hair and soaked his coat.  He clutched the bundle he carried as
if it were a baby.

The man led the other man led the other man up to the attic.  He didn't
offer to take the other man's wet coat or carry the bundle.

The Colonel was waiting for them in the attic in his usual spot, in the 
chair by the armoire.

“I have the ingredients,” said the other man.

“*All* of the ingredients?” said the first man.

“Yes. All of them,” the second man finally let go of his bundle and
handed it to the first man.

“I heard the police caught you in the cemetery.”

“Yes,” said the second man.

“Did they take what you brought with you out of the cemetery?”

“I brought nothing out of the cemetery,” said the second man.

He held up his right hand, which was wrapped in a bloody cloth.
For a moment, the first man looked stunned.  Then he recovered
himself and started to inspect the contents of the bundle.

“Resourceful,” was all the first man said. He began to put the things
around the room, one in front of each candle.  There was a dead cat.
There was a gold watch.  There was a lock of fine dark hair.  There
was a finger, and there was a handful of dirt.

Penny stood in front of the new man and looked into his face.  His
eyes were dark pools of longing and sorrow. Penny looked into dark
pools, before.  She lived in one, now, and her eyes had adjusted to
the gloom.  She looked into the man's eyes and she saw behind the
sadness a kind of cupidity.  A raw, unnatural desire.  There was loss
in this man's life, but it had been festering in his heart and changing
into something new for years, decades.  It had become a demon now, and
controlled him.  Penny felt sorry for him, and a little afraid of him.

The first man put the second into the center of the design he had drawn
on the floor with black dust.  He gave him the drugged wine and waved
the burning bundle of twigs under his nose.  Most of this meant nothing
to Penny, but the finger, the hair, the dirt.  These things had a
fearful attraction for her.  She could tell that Colonel Bart coveted them
as well.  He was fingering the gold watch as the first man uncovered his
machine.

“You have the image of the person in your mind?” asked the first man.

“Every moment,” said the second.

“Call to her.”

“Now?”

“Yes.  Now.”

“Sonja,” said the man, quietly.  “Sonja.”

“Good.  Call her to you from wherever she has gone.  Call her.”

“*Sonja,*” called the man.  He was putting some intensity into it.  Penny
didn't recognize the name.  She hadn't come though the house.

The second man went into a sort of a trance, calling out his Sonja's name,
while the first wheeled his machine closer.  It was copper and glass and
bellows.  It had a long tube ending in a rubber mouth that looked like 
some sea creature.

Penny saw that the Colonel was engrossed in the watch, so she edged closer
to the pale finger, stained with fresh blood.  She made sure that the
Colonel wasn't watching and she touched the knuckle affectionately.
