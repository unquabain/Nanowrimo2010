## Penny saw the wind

Just out of town, at the end of a windy road overgrown
with hanging false cedars, at the top of a hill, in an
old Victorian house, in the attic, by the window Penny sat
and no longer wept.  She no longer looked at the grey clouds
or the distant, muddy green hills.  She now looked between
the trees, between the branches, between the leaves.  She
looked until she couldn't see any longer, and then she saw
the wind.
