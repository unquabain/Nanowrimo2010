# Chapter 2010-11-06 - 4

Jovius hiked his backback higher on his back for the somethingth time.  Hundredth?
Millionth?  The clouds had vanished, and he thought that was a good sign, but it
had turned out to be a hot day.  *If it's not one thing, it's another,* thought Jovius
to himself with a grumble.  The strange man from the cemetery had given him a wad of
cash after Jovius had explained his tale of hardship over breakfast in a diner.  He
had milked it, of course.  Downplayed the part where the whole thing was his idea.

So now he was heading out of town again.  He had decided to head South for the winter,
deciding it effecacious to forget his vow never to end up in California.  He had gotten
directions before leaving town, but the longer he walked, the less sense the directions
seemed to make.  Now the road rose steeply into the hills.

Jovius stopped suddenly and checked himself.  He was a minstrel, after all.  This was
an adventure.  The sun was out.  He had a wallet full of money.  Why was he so grumpy?
Wasn't this what he had wanted? Total freedom?

He got out his guitar and slung it over his shoulders.  Though his mind told him he
should be reveling in living his dream, the feeling had not yet been communicated to
his heart or his uneasy stomach.  He strummed a few happy chords on his guitar and
struck up a rhythm.  But as he marched up the hill among the drooping cedars, the
chords fell to the minor again.

When he saw the house, the guitar fell silent.

The old Victorian stood all alone at the top of the hill and peered down at the city
like a fat raven scanning a field for fresh carrion.

Jovius sighed and looked again.  It was just his mood that colored it in such dire
hues.  It was a pretty house, after all.  The garden was well tended, the paint was
bright and fresh.  An autumn wreath hung on the door.  A penant waved from a rod
on the top of the conical roof of a round corner room, like a tower of a castle.

What worried Jovius still, however, is that the road seemed to end at this house.
This was supposed to take him to the highway, where he could hitch down to the 
Bay Area before nightfall.

Well.  Shit.  He looked down the winding road along which he had come and saw the town
far below in the valley.  Shit.  If he had gone wrong following the directions early,
there was no way he could get to the highway in enough time to get to San Francisco before
night.  He might have to spend some or even all of his windfall cash on a Greyhound.

It might not be that bad.  He might have just forgotten a turn he was supposed to take
from this road.  Thinking back on the directions he had been following, he felt a sudden
haze or confusion, like trying to figure out the tip on a restaurant bill split between
twelve liberal drinkers.  Each step in the instructions slid away from him in his memory
and changed places.  Right turned into left and landmarks played hide and seek.

*Fuck it,* said Jovius, and climbed the porch steps to knock on the wide wooden door of
the house.

After a while, when no one answered, he knocked again.  Then, when he was about to turn
away, the door opened.  It was dim inside and he couldn't quite make out any shapes on
the other side of the door, but a girl's voice said “Can I help you?”

“Jovius is the name of the man you see before you.  Travelling minstrel, story teller,
balladier, thief of hearts, not of diamonds.”

“Can I help you, Thief of Hearts?” said the girl again.

“If you insist, you may,” said Jovius, “but I will pay for your assistance.  Let me
in and I shall sing you a song to put a light in your eyes.  In return, you can
tell me how to the fuck out of this town.  Oops! Sorry, is your... are your parents
home?”

“My parents?” said the girl uncertainly, but then she said “I think the Colonel
would like to hear some music.  Please come in.”

She opened the door wider and Jovius was able to see her in the shadows.  She was a
pale girl, but pretty.

“Thank you, my lady,” said Jovius, striding inside.  “And how shall I address this
vision of vision of budding feminine youth and innocence?”

“My name is Penny,” said Penny, “Penny Cold.”
