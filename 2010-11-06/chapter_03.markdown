# Chapter 2010-11-06 - 3

The girl, Harper, had not seemed to any of her friends to be a jumper.
Sheriff Cold had met with the same degree of bewilderment from each of
the girls glassmates and friends when he had talked to them. Some had
reacted with dull stares of incomprehension. Some had reacted almost
angrily, stopping only just short of calling Sheriff Cold a liar for
suggesting that Harper had committed suicide.

Many had suggested some variety of foul play.

The total lack of evidence and the total inability of anyone to name
anyone who would have wanted to hurt the girl in any way more than the
thousand pins and cuts young people habitually hurt each other made
Sheriff Cold dismiss the idea.

But that was before Bailey Purfoy turned up behind the stadium bleachers
with his wrists cut.

Bailey, like Harper, was a generally happy kid. Had Bailey known Harper?
It was likely. It was a pretty small town. Had Bailey and Harper been
involved? No one had any information about that.

Sheriff Cold was keeping Coincidence at the top of his list of suspects
until one school administrator sheepishly asked him about whose
responsibility it would be to clean up the blood from under the stadium,
the school's or the city's. That caused Sheriff Cold to reflect that,
despite the fact that the boy had his father's antique straight razor in
his hand, there wasn't a lot of blood at the scene. The boy's clothes
had been stained with it and the ground had a fair amount, but...

The closest thing Sheriff Cold had to a forensics department was a
loose professional relationship with the highschool Science teacher,
Mr. Scroter. Unfortunately, Bailey was one of Mr. Scroter's students and
he was unable to spend much time at the scene without feeling the need
to vomit into a bag he brought with him for collecting any evidence he
might have found.

Mr. Scroter did confirm for Sheriff Cold, however, that not enough
blood had been spilt at the scene to explain Bailey's death. He was not
able to say that Bailey had been dragged there from someplace else or to
determine the hight and physical condition of Bailey's assailant from his
footprint or determine the exact location that Bailey met his assassin by
examining a flake of paint found under a rock or any of the things that
science tells policemen on the television.

So Sheriff Cold went over to the Purfoy house and looked in every room
for blood, and found none.  He even brought his dog, Beauregard, to help
him look.  Beauregard was not a police dog, and he managed to find a
highly suspicious squirrel casing the residence and, on the inside,
a french fry, possibly the murderer's, under the kitchen table which
Beauregard promptly confiscated.

Sheriff Cold gave up on the CSI stuff and fell back on his strengths.
In further interviews with Bailey's classmates, he discovered a loose
association with a group of androgynous individuals.  These individuals
were brought together by their shared affection for wearing bits of
metal through their clothes and the skin of their faces, smoking cigarettes
and drinking very inexpensive—but dear because illegal to them—malt liquors.

Sheriff Cold's most effective interview technique was the silent stare.
He could outstare anyone and found that any information he required—and
quite a lot he would never have use for—could be obtained by simply waiting
patiently for it. It took all of Sheriff Cold's considerable sitting quietly
ability, however, to learn that the meeting place for enjoying cigarettes and malt
liquors was the first floor of the old Bart Mansion.

As predictable as this was, it made Sheriff Cold's stomach turn when he first
heard it.  Sitting in his own interview room in his own station, he had a 
revisit of the vertigo from the attic of the Bart place.

*****

The Bart place.

It had been bothering him since he first saw Harper's body lying in the road
under the Cedars.  It sat up on a hill looking down on his town, and those
curtainless windows were watching him wherever he went.
