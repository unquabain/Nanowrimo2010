# Chapter 2010-11-27 - 6

Colonel Bart stood over the two prone men and yelled things to the remaining man
such as “quickly now!” and “The blood! The blood!”

But Penny could feel it.  When the man had moved the candle from the edge of the
circle, something had been broken.  Not completely.  What had been begun wasn't
completed yet, but it was running wild now.

Penny touched the finger she had been coveting and saw it move.  It moved!  She
wrapped her hand around it and felt it in her fist.  She lifted and picked it
up.  Bart was still haranguing the man as the latter attempted to re-affix the 
machine to the nearly-completed sacrifice.  No one was paying attention to her.
She took the finger and put it in her mouth.

Just then, Colonel Bart glanced at her.

“Don't worry, my dear.  This interruption is not important.  Soon you will be
re-bound to me.  Soon.  Does that make you happy?”

Penny smiled, but didn't show her teeth.  She could feel them in her mouth,
pointed, sharp as knives now, weapons.   In a moment, Bart had forgotten
about her again and she slipped out of the attic and down the stairs.  She
ran to the front door and felt the repulsion, like magnets.  She pushed against
it until she was standing at the door.  It had been ripped off its hinges and 
the rain was pouring in.  The Wind was waiting for her outside, calling for
her through the door, but it still could not come in and she still could not
go out.

But she had the finger, now.

She reached into her mouth and found the bit of protruding bone and pulled.
Her sharpened teeth easily stripped the flesh away and out came the cleaned
bones.  Three of them.

She went right up to the invisible border.  It hurt her to be this close, but
she forced herself.  She reached out her hand and could feel it, like a glass wall.
She pushed against it.  She put her shoulder against it, and then her forehead.
She pushed it with all her might and it moved.  She pushed it through the door,
inch by inch, her feet slipping on the wet floor.  With each inch she pushed it,
its force became stronger, pushing her back into the house.

Panting and sweating, she managed to push the first small bone out the door and
wedge it between the house and the invisible wall.  It held.  The force pinned
the bone to the house, but the bone also kept the glass wall from coming back in.

Next, she pushed at the other end of the wall until she had the second bone wedged
between the other side of the door and the invisible wall.

Now the wall was outside the house by a fraction of an inch and she could relax
for a moment.  She took the third bone, the longest, and she held it at waist
height.  She thrust it against the invisible wall until she felt it puncture
the wall.  She let go and it stayed where she put it, hanging in mid-air.

She reached her arms out and grabbed each side of the door jamb for balance and
then put one foot on the bone floating in mid-air and lifted herself up.  The bone
was not long and only held the tip of her toe.  Now she was up, balanced on top
of the bone, holding onto the door jamb.  The field was still pushing her away,
but her fingernails were long and sharp now, like claws, and they dug into the wood
of the door and held her there.

And there was a dilemma.  She couldn't let go of the door or she would be blown back
into the house.  But she needed to let go in order to climb up and over the invisible wall.

The bone under her toe made a troubling cracking noise.  Penny moved her hands in small,
quick jerks.  Releasing and re-grabbing the door jambs a little higher, inching her
arms up above her head.  She could feel the top of the wall now.

“Penny!” called Colonel Bart from behind her.  “Penny stop! I command you!”

Some part of Penny wanted to stop.  Colonel Bart still had a great deal of command over
her, the spell was not completely broken.  Penny's arms felt suddenly very weak.  She felt
her nails pulling out of the wood, getting ready to let go.

“Penny, come back to me and sing for me!”

Penny closed her eyes and was about to let go.  Back to Colonel Bart, forever this time.
