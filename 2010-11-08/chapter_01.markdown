# Chapter 2010-11-08 - 1

The tramp ate oatmeal in Sheriff Cold's kitchen.  Alice put a cup of steaming coffee in front of him
and he grunted his thanks through a mouthful.  Sheriff Cold didn't touch his oatmeal, but watched
the tramp carefully.  The tramp, a performer, was used to being watched and was at ease with it.  The
Sheriff had never known his silent observation technique to fail, but there was a first time for
everything.  Perhaps Alice was too much of a distraction, bustling about the kitchen and making
idle conversation.

“I'd like you to come to the station with me this morning,” the Sheriff said at last.  This made
the tramp look up.  He didn't stop eating.

“Oh, sir, you've been more than kind enough already.  I won't be any more trouble to you.  I'm
heading South today, anyway.”

“South?” said Sheriff Cold.

“To San Francisco… maybe LA.  It's too cold here.”

Sheriff Cold nodded and seemed to assent, but nevertheless he said “You're not going South to
LA today.”

“Oh no?” said the tramp around another mouthful.

Sheriff Cold never repeated himself.  When he didn't say anything at all, the tramp put down his
spoon and asked “Why am I not going South to LA today?”

Sheriff Cold made his mustache bristle.

“I suppose I'll be at the police station.”

Sheriff Cold was satisfied enough with this response to lower his eyes and look at his oatmeal
for the first time.  He took a bite.

“Am I in trouble?  I told you I don't know how I got into that house.  I'm not on drugs or
anything.  I, heh, I can't afford them.”

Sheriff Cold glanced up through one bushy eyebrow.

“Look, seriously.  I…”

“There have been a few accidents in town recently.”

“Accidents?”

“It's my job to make sure that they *are* accidents.”

“What kind of accidents?”

Sheriff Cold finished his oatmeal with a surprisingly small number of efficient spoonfuls
and rose to get his official hat.  He got up and went to the door and held it open for
the tramp.

The tramp didn't rise and Sheriff Cold didn't move at the door.  The tramp tried to eat another
spoonfull of oatmeal, but somehow when this audience was behind his back, outside of his
field of view, his gaze was more intense.  The tramp couldn't get the spoon into his mouth
and his head sunk between his shoulders like a scolded animal.  He dropped the spoon and
got out of his chair.  He was about to go through the door that Sheriff Cold was holding
open for him, when a glance from the Sheriff reminded him to grab his kit and axe.

And then they were in the Sheriff's car, and then they were at the station.

*****

At the station, there was paperwork already queued up for Sheriff Cold.  More than usual.
There was a report of a break-in at the cemetery—nothing vandalized; a coroner's report
on the boy from the stadium; Mr. Scroter's report on the scene. That caused a dark smile
to touch the corners of Sheriff Cold's eyes.  The science teacher had been next to useless
and he knew it, but all the same he had filed his report in his careful, curious block
letters.  One might have said that Mr. Scroter crossed every T and dotted every I, but
in Mr. Scroter's blocky letters, the I's and T's were always capital.  Only the flourish
on the signature at the bottom showed any sort of flexibility.

A strange duck, Mr. Scroter.

But a strange duck that would have to wait. The Sheriff had something else to attend to.

He led the tramp into the interview room.  It was designed to be intimidating, but Sheriff
Cold always found this windowless, sound-dampened, grey-walled room to be the most soothing place he
knew of.  Not that Sheriff Cold was the type of man who allowed himself to be soothed
under anything less than extraordinary circumstances.

The tramp, Sheriff Cold observed, was not soothed by the interview room.  The tramp needed
spaces and sky.

The tramp sat at one side of the table and the sheriff sat on the other.  They stared at
one another for a while, waiting for the other to speak first.  When the tramp raised his
eyebrows at the sheriff, the sheriff yielded and said “The house?”

“I told you before.”

“Yes.”

“Heading out of town.  Got directions from the gas station.  Got lost. Found the old house.”


“Got directions at what time?”

“I don't know, nine o'clock.”

“You got lost when?”

“When I didn't take that left turn at Albuquerque.”

The sheriff's mustache bristled.  If the tramp was playing Buggs Bunny, that made him Elmer
Fudd.  He filed that for later.

“What time did you find the house?”

The tramp flourished his bare wrists.

“Day or night?”

“Day.”

“Morning?”

“No.”

“Afternoon.”

“No.  Maybe.”

“Noon, then.”

“I don't know.”

“Shadows long or short?”

“What am I, Sacajawea?  Short.  Short shadows.”

The sheriff's mustache bristled again.

“And between that time and 10:47 when I found you?”

“I told you.  I don't remember. Why don't you believe me.”

“Maybe if you told me your name.”

“I told you.  I don't remember that either.”

Sheriff Cold sighed a sigh that rumbled and thought about what came next.  He didn't come up
with anything, however, before the interview room door opened and officer Mitchell poked her
head in.

“Sorry to bother you, Cold, but it's the coroner.  He wants to know if you've seen his report
yet.”

Sheriff Cold furrowed his lush brows at her.

“He seems very anxious that you see his report.  He said it was ‘curious.’”

Sheriff Cold pushed his moustache over onto one cheek and tapped the table with his ring finger
for exactly three and one half seconds.  Then he nailed the tramp to the chair with his eyes,
hoisted his mass from his chair and lumbered, bear like, from the room.

When Sheriff Cold reached his desk, his phone was off the hook.  Officer Mitchell picked it up
and handed it to Cold as he fished the report out from the pile on his desk.

“Cold,” he said into the receiver.

The coroner had found a curious wound on the body of the boy.  On the neck.  There was some
bruising that looked like a love bite, but on closer inspection, he found two small puncture
wounds.  Cold said nothing, waiting for the coroner to continue.  The continuation was that
the girl, Harper, had had identical marks on her neck.
