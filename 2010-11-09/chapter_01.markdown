# Chapter 2010-11-09 - 1

Demos Ioannou got out of bed carefully, so as not to wake his sleeping wife.
He slipped on his slippers.
He padded quietly down the stairs of his house.  He longed to stomp, to cry
out, to draw on the walls, to bang pots, to scatter Lego blocks across the
floor.  But he moved silently through the heavy curtain of silence that hung
in his house since that day.

He got to the kitchen and put the kettle on the burner.  Then he sat in a chair
and listened with cotton ears to the lead-lined silence of his house and waited
for the water to become hot so it would whistle raucously at him for a moment.

Before that happened, however, he snapped the dial on the range off and left
the kitchen.  He got his long, cashmere coat—still with mud stains from the
night in the cemetery—and put it on over his pajamas.  He opened the door and
stepped out into the night.

There was a light rain, between a mist and a rain, on the streets.  There were
no streetlamps on his street and no sidewalks.  Only a carpet of damp fir needles
to soften his footsteps.  He meant to walk around the blook, but when he got
to the end of the block, he went straight.  He meant to turn back at the intersection
with the light, but he turned left instead.  He stopped at the all night convenience
store for coffee in a styrofoam cup and a jelly-filled pie crust thing.  He meant to
turn back then, but he took his coffee on down toward the city center. 

He walked across the bridge, out to the very middle.  He looked at the reflected
lights of the town in the still water of the slow moving river.  Orange and green
streaks in the black water.  He took the wrapper off of his pie and stuffed it
into his coat pocket, then he let the uneaten half of it fall into the water below.
It was too dark to see the splash and he was a little disappointed.  He sipped
the last of his now luke-warm coffee and stuffed the empty cup into his other
coat pocket.

He climbed up onto the railing.

And sat.

Now there was nothing between his feet and the water below.  He felt a little like
he was flying or walking on water.  What would it be like to walk on water, he wondered.
To just stride down the river as if it were a road.  To go anywhere he liked and not
worry about traffic, just walk down the river to the Great Lakes.  This river joined
with the Great Lakes, didn't it? Surely every river and stream on this continent
joined with the Great Lakes.  He would walk down this river until it joined up with
Lake Superior, walk over that to Lake Michigan and to Lake Huron and Lake Boris and 
the Other One.  Whatever. Then up past Niagara Falls and out across the Atlantic.
He would walk past Newfoundland and through the Strait of Gibraltar and past
Charybdis in the Strait of Messina and then around the downstretched hand of Greece
in the center of the world to Amaliapolis where he bathed in the warm, blue salt
water as a child.

He shifted his seat a little on the cold, slick railing.

He kicked his feet a little and saw them, dark shadows, moving back and forth over
the black water.  He imagined them walking on the water.

If you would walk on water, what else could you do?  Raise Lazarus from the dead?

His heart jumped into his throat and he had to look up at the sky in order to swallow
it back down.  The falling rain fell into his eyes and blurred his vision.  So he closed
them tightly and squeezed the rain out.  Squeezed all the rain that had fallen into his
eyes out like wringing a towel.  And out the water flowed.  All that rain which had
collected in his eyes on his walk. It ran down his cheeks.  Warm and salty like the
sea in the center of the world.

He slipped a little on the railing and had to catch himself.  Too close.  Too close
to falling into the black water.  No, he was not ready for that yet.  Then why had
he come?
