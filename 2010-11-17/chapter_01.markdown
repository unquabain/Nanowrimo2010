# Chapter 2010-11-17 - 1

When the morning sun struck the tramp, he was still staggaring along, but he was no
longer conscious.  His feet fell one in front of another and some automatic mechanism
in his brain kept him from colliding with the grape vines, but he was not piloting his
own ship.

It was hunger that finally awakened him.  An uncomfortable gurgling in his stomach
made him realize how awful he felt.  Still dizzy from loss of blood, dehydrated now,
and fatigued from walking all night, he tripped and fell to his knees.  In front of
his face: juicy, ripe grapes.  Some part of his brain had just enough juice left in it
to remind him that in many, many the stories, eating the food in the strange faerie
land was as good as sealing your fate.  Like Persephone, it would bind him to this
world and he could never get home again.  But then another part of his brain, an
altogether more pragmatic part, reminded him that if he died of hunger and exhaustion
here, he'd not get back either.  So he plucked a bunch of the grapes and he devoured
them without tasting them.

Then he ate a second bunch and had time to notice how incredible they tasted.  That
made his heart sink a little, becuse they tasted better than grapes ought to.  But
that pragmatic part of his brain spoke up again and reminded him that he was low
on blood sugar and grapes were probably exactly what his body needed, so of course
they tasted supernaturally good to him.

After the third bunch of grapes, his head began to clear a little.  He stood up
and looked around.  In the daylight, the vinyard looked perfectly ordinary and canny.
At the top of the hill stood the old mansion.  At the bottom of the hill, the forest.

The forest still felt like a brooding shadow to him, so he started to walk toward
the house.  Now that there was a house, perhaps there would be a door.  If there
were a door, perhaps it would lead him home.

He realized he still had his guitar with him, so he slung it over his shoulder.
He attempted a chord experimentally to see if its unfortunate warm might have
corrected itself in the warm air.  The chord sounded alright.  He tried a run
of notes across the neck, and it was alright.  He tried it an octave higher and
there was an unpleasant buzz.  His guitar was a wounded soldier now, but it was
still his only friend.

Feeling not at all certain about his surroundings, benign enough seeming in the
bright sun, so he began to play.

As he approached the house, however, a creeping fingers started up his spine
and he let the instrument fall silent.

He reached the porch and sighed.  He put his foot onto the first step and lifted
himself onto it.  It creaked a little.  It almost sounded like a voice.  He took
another step and another and he was on the porch.

He walked up to the door, and his footfalls on the wooden decking sounded hollow
and ominous.

He put a hand on the door knob.  It felt icy cold.  It seemed to vibrate a little
in his hand and he thought he could hear something on the other side: either a
whisper of voices or the howl of storm winds.  The tramp braced himself to find
out what might be there when all of a sudden, the door swung toward him and nearly
bloodied his nose.  He stepped back just in time to avoid it, and there on the
other side...

... was the woman!

They both screamed and the tramp took several steps back, lost his footing on the
edge of the porch and toppled down the stairs onto the ground.

The woman froze for a moment, but then when she saw that the tramp was incapacitated,
she launched herself toward him, arms outstreached with a cry.  The tramp scrambled
crab-like away from her, slipping in the dust.  She stopped at the top of the stairs
and waved her hands about in the air, making cries.

The tramp managed to get purchase with his feet and stood up, twisting as he did
so to run away, but his guitar strap had looped itself around his leg and he wound
up falling into his guitar, crushing the traitorous instrument with a cacophony of
crashes and twangs.

Then she was upon him, her hands on his back, grasping him, pulling him toward her,
lifting him…

…sitting him upright, patting the dust off of him, smoothing his hair, straightening
his shirt.

He looked at her and saw her face close to his and he recoiled in fear and revulsion.
However, she threw her hands up in the air and backed off, saying “Oh dear!”

When the tramp had put six or eight feet between them, he stopped.  He looked carefully
at her and saw she had neither tail, nor claws.  Her eyes were human eyes, soft and brown.

He couldn't see her teeth because she clasped her hands over her mouth.

Then she said “I'm sorry.  I won't hurt you.”

It was her voice, more than anything about her appearance, that started to convince
the tramp that here was a young woman in her early twenties, not a ferocious monstor
intent on devouring him.

“Who are you?” she asked, “What's your name?”

The tramp didn't have a good answer for that one, so he said nothing.

“Was that you playing the guitar before?  The Whispers sometimes make noise, but
I've never heard them make music before.  I'd forgotten about music.  I'd forgotten
that I used to like to listen to music.  Oh! But your guitar is ruined.  I have…
yes, I think I saw… well come inside and we'll have a look.  Come inside and…
oh! but you're hurt!  You've had an accident, look at you! You're all scratched
up!”

She approached him cautiously and put a hand on his cheek.  The tramp recoiled from
her hand, but she persisted and the tramp relented.  Her hand was soft and cool.

“What did this to you?”

“Bear,” said the tramp.  “In the woods.”

“The Bear did this?“ she asked.  She pursed her lips and looked off toward the
forest.  She shook her head and said to herself “that Bear.”  She sighed.

Then she brightened and said “don't worry, she can't cross the stream.  You're
safe here in the vinyard and in the house.  There's nothing on this side that
can hurt you!”

The tramp shivered as if with a sudden chill, but he didn't disagree out loud.
But then her forehead wrinkled in confusion.  “Are you sure the Bear did this?
This doesn't seem like her.  I mean, why didn't she just eat you?”

“Stick,” said the tramp, “hit her with a stick.”  The woman cocked her head to
the side and looked at him through the corners of her eyes as if she didn't
quite believe him, but she didn't press the point.

“Come in the house.  My name is Sonja.  This is my house.  My husband won't mind
if you come in to get cleaned up and something to eat.  And maybe, I think I saw…
somewhere… well come in.”

Her long fingers reached under his arms and she began to try to lift him.  She was
clearly not strong enough.  Or else she was acting weak.  That creature in the night
was certainly strong enough to lift him or throw him if it wished.  The tramp got to
his feet and let her lead him into the big house.

“Sonja?” he asked.

“That's me,” she said and smiled brightly.  Human teeth.

“And what's your husband's name?”

“You know,” she said brightly, “I don't think I know,” as if it hadn't ever thought of
it before-wasn't that funny-and, oh well, it's not that important anyway.

The inside of the house was completely different than he was expecting.  He entered
into a hall lined with statues and paintings.  This hall opened out into a ballroom with 
grand curving staircases sweeping up and around to a balcony.  How did all this fit into
a house the size of the mansion.  It was big, but not *this* big!  Strangest of all,
there was groove running through the polished marble floor through which ran a stream.
It ran swiftly over rocks and had little ferns and rushes growing on either side of it.

Sonja lead him through the room and, at one point, they needed to hop over the stream
to cross it.  She led him through a door on the far side of the ball room and into a
maze of corridors, all brightly lit, until they came to a bedroom.  She pointed to a
door and indicated that there was a bathroom.  The tramp investigated and found that,
indeed, there was a very spaceous bathroom.

She left him alone in the bathroom and he sat on a small chair for a while, too terrified
and confused to move.

Finally, he decided cautiously to undress and shower.  Throughout the brief exercise, 
he kept thinking of the movie Psycho, only instead of knives, his imaginary assailant
came at him with silver fish eyes and sharpened piranha teeth.  He examined the bite
marks on his chest and arms.  They were real enough.  They were still raw and they
bled when he scrubbed them.  The water swirled red around the drain.

Nothing happened, however, except that when he emerged from the shower, his clothes
were gone and a new set of clean clothes waited for him.  They were almost unbearably
preppy, as if he were expected to go for a sail after a quick game of tennis, but they
were clean and they appeared to fit him perfectly.

When he emerged from the bathroom, Sonja was nowhere to be found.  He left the bedroom
and ventured timidly down a hallway.  He heard a noise behind a door and followed it.
He found Sonja in a small kitchen with small dining
nook set into one wall.  She greeted him and put him in a chair in this nook and then said to no one in 
particular, “our guest is hungry.”

Immediately, the kitchen was filled with the sounds of voices, barely audible.  They
remained just below the tramp's level of hearing, so he couldn't make out what they
were saying, but soon dishes started to appear on the table out of thin air.  There was
cheese and bread and bottles of wine.  There were plates of cold cuts and sausages.

“I had some grapes,” said the tramp.

“Oh, we have excellent grapes!” said Sonja.  Well have some cheese, then.  And the
wine, the wine is… the wine… Well, help yourself.”

The tramp did help himself to some cheese and bread and a few cold cuts, but he drank
only water.

Sonja didn't eat, but sat across the table and chatted brightly about the house and
the book she was reading and this and that.  Somehow the tramp wasn't able to remember
any of it.

After he had finished eating, she took him on a tour of more rooms in this house which
continued to seem impossibly bigger on the inside than on the out.

They wound up in a small room that looked like it belonged in a cottage rather than in
this inside-out palace.  It was filled with instruments of every description.  The usual
guitars and violins, drum kits and banjos, saxophones and cellos.  More exotic instruments as well:
chinese spike fiddles, lyres, sitars.  There were many there that the tramp couldn't
recognize.

Sonja moved a side a golden lyre that seemed to glow with its own light and took from behind
it a black guitar.  She handed it to the tramp, saying “here.”

The tramp looked at it, but didn't take it.

“It's for you!” Sonja said.  “To replace the one that you broke when I startled you.  I'm very
sorry.”

When the tramp still didn't take the guitar, which seemed now less simply “black” as somehow
so finely polished that light seemed to slide off it, she added “I'm sure my husband won't mind.”

The tramp took the guitar and held it awkwardly.

“Go ahead,” said Sonja, sitting on a chair and folding her hands in her lap, “play me something.”

The tramp struck a chord and it was as if an orchestra had begun to play.  The strings accepted his
fingers and seemed to urge them on.  They seemed to pull his fingers toward the next notes.  So he
played.  He played a song he didn't recognize, but which came as naturally to him as a mother's lullabye.

His fingers slowly loosened up as if they were thawing.  Soon notes were rippling from the
fretboard and surrounding him.  He was inside the music.  There was nothing except him and
this seductive guitar and the music.

No, there inside the music too was Sonja, sitting on her chair with her hands folded, her face open
and smiling.  Her eyes were wide and soft and human.  She was as enraptured by the music as the
tramp was.  She was moving along to it with him.  They were moving together, the tramp, Sonja and
the guitar.  It flowed through them and filled up the house.

The tramp opened his mouth to sing a lyric that suddenly occurred to him, but instead of his practiced
barytone, out came a rasping rattle.  The spell was broken and the music was only the sound of plucked
strings again and they were in a room.

The tramp stopped playing abruptly in the middle of a measure and dropped the guitar to his side, suddenly
feeling ashamed.

Sonja seemed not to have heard his strange, froglike croak or noticed the abrupt ending of the song.  She
cooed and complimented him on his playing.  She bubbled like a fountain.  She stood and touched the
tramp on the elbow as she explained how moved she was by the music.

She seemed so honest and unguarded that the tramp was left with the impression not of a woman in her early
twenties as she appeared, but of a girl of eleven or twelve taken with the rapture of a live rock concert.”

The tramp was genuinely complimented and he blushed and he…

…yes, he smiled.
