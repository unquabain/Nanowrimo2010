# Chapter 2010-11-03 - 1

Sonja found herself in a strange room in a strange house. Or was it a
cave? It was neither and both. She had followed the invisible dancers
past the forest, into a valley, up a merry spring. The walls of the
valley became steeper, the stream became faster. At some point, the
valley closed above her head and she was inside.

Despite the earth walls, it was not dirty.

Despite the running stream through the center, it was not damp.

Despite the moss, or perhaps because of it, it was not uncomfortable.

Crystal stallactites hung from the ceiling and perhaps emitted light,
perhaps reflected it. Either way, it was not dark.

She was in a bright hall with a floor flat and smooth enough for
dancing. Whispering voices surrounded her still and her robe of woven
ribbons also whispered as she moved. The stream gurgled.

Sonja moved about the room, exploring. The whispers came with her. They
all seemed excited about something and it made Sonja excited too. There
were passages leading off from this central hall. Each broad and vaulted
in a way that could have been natural or could have been the height of
architecture, the envy of all the cathedral builders who ever lived. She
moved through the passage ways to other, smaller rooms. These had mossy
rocks that were just the right size for her to sit in. They had grooved
walls that looked as if they might hold any number of fascinating books.
In one, she found a broad, flat, moss-less rock high enough to be a
dining room table and about it smaller, mossy rocks that were high
enough for sitting. She tried one out, sliding her bottom into the
indentation in one of the smaller rocks and pretending to be at table.

The whispers grew more excited than ever. The invisible speakers seemed
to grow more numerous. Sonja noticed that the flat table-rock was not
barren as she first supposed. In front of her, a small patch of moss
grew and caught in it, some leaves and twigs that must have been blown
in from outside. Perhaps an old nest.

Not so old, the twigs had blood-red berries on them still. She put
a berry in her mouth and popped it with her teeth.  It was sweet and
spicy.  She tried another one.  The twig it was on was fragrant as well,
something like cinnamon, but not quite.  She peeled some of its moist,
leather-like bark and took a bite.  She found she could chew it easily
and that it was quite good tasting.

Now that she had put some food in her mouth, she realized that, it
having been more than a decade since the last time she ate, she was
absolutely ravenous.  She stuffed her face with red berries and leaves
and twig bark as fast as she could.  Everything she put into her mouth
tasted of spices, sweet or savory, and all exotic and wonderful.  The
more she ate, the more she noticed on the stone table in front of her.

She ate until she felt stuffed. Dark red berry juice covered her mouth and
chin like a beard and dripped from her fingertips.

Suddenly, she felt ashamed of her state, of the stains on her dress,
of her matted, stained, knotted hair.  She remembered the stream 
running through the great hall and ran through the rooms to find it
again.  She came upon the great hall far sooner than she expected
and it startled her.  She ran to the stream and dove her hands in.
The water was cool.  She splashed her face and drank a little.  Just
as she had suddenly realized how hungry she was at the table, she
now lost control of herself again as she drank from the clear stream.
Like an animal on all fours, she lapped up the water.  She put her
whole face in the water, then her whole head.  It was cold and swift
and she felt it flowing through her hair, pulling the knots out,
pulling away the twigs and leaves that had gotten caught in it.  She
rolled into the stream and let the water flow over her body, over the
ribbon dress.  Blood-red berry juice flowed away from her in clouds.

When suddenly Sonja realized that her behavior had gone from strange
to stranger, she hauled herself out of the water as rapidly as she
could.  She was clumsy.  Her joints were stiff with the cold and
her dress was wet and heavy.  The stone floor was slippery under
her wet feet.

She managed to get to her feet and stood there, dripping, dishevled.
This hall, she thought, was far too grand, far too beautiful for
something as filthy and wretched as herself.  Sonja began to
cry.

But then the voices came again, whispering to her.  They seemed 
excited, still.  They seemed to be urging her to something.
They were leading her to another opening in the side of the
great hall.  She followed them.  She passed through more 
passages and rooms, each more and more homely seeming until
she came to a room that was different from the others.  The
moss lay thick and soft on the ground.  Deeper underground, this
room was warmer, as if close to some sort of volcanic steam
vent.  A large stone stood in the middle of the room like an
altar or another table.  This was so thickly covered in moss that
it almost looked like piles of pillows and comforters.  Sonja
realized she was tired, so she climbed up onto the bed, for
she realized of course that that's what it must be, and laid her
head on one of the larger tufts of moss.  The bed was soft
and it was warm and Sonja fell asleep almost immediately.
