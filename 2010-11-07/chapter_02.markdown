# Chapter 2010-11-07 - 2

Jovius entered the dark house and waited for his eyes to adjust to the gloom.
There was plenty of rich woodwork and fine furniture.  Paintings in an old style
of people in old clothes lined the walls.  The girl who had let him in was slight
and pale.  She looked to be about fifteen, perhaps.  She was slender and willowy
and dressed in an old-fashioned dress with poofy sleeves.

“This way,” she told him, “the Colonel is in the library.”

As Jovius moved through the finely decorated house, he felt that every
mended rip and travel stain in his clothes must be giving off some sort
of grimy odor that the girl was ignoring. She let him into a room with
a wide bay window. A stout man with impressive grey mutton chops was
standing by the window. Another man was in the room as well. He looked
to be dressed in baggy, white pajamas with a white cap and was wearing a
black mask over his eyes with a huge nose like a phallas.

“I didn't know you had an entertainer here already,” said Jovius.

“He's a friend of the family who comes from time to time,” said
Penny.

“Hello,” said Jovius to the man. The man nodded his head, waving his
improbable nose.

“Sing us a song, Balladier!” said the mutton-chopped man before Penny had
spoken a word.  “Sing us a song about death and sorrow.  Then sing us a
song about merry dances and springtime.  And then sing us a song about
long lost friends who we shall never meet again.  Sing! Let your voice
and your strings ring through these dusty halls of memory! BEGIN!”

Jovius, who was used to be the most florid-tongued in any gathering,
felt himself begin to stammer, so bit his tongue instead.  He dropped
his backpack where he stood and swung his guitar around on its strap
and began to sing a song about death and sorrow.

In retrospect, he thought, he should have picked a better song for the
setting.  He chose a song about a drug dealer who ran away with the wife
of a police man and about the chase he gave them across state lines and
the trail of carnage and disaster that followed them.  Nevertheless, the
muttonchopped man seemed to enjoy it.  The girl, however, sat by the window
and stared whistfully out.  She didn't seem to hear the music at all.
The fellow in the clown suit kept his piercing eyes on Jovius the entire 
song and didn't seem to blink once.  The mask concealed his emotion,
however, and Jovius couldn't tell what he was thinking.

When he was done, the muttonchopped man clapped his thick, chuck roast
hands together loudly and called “Well done, sir! And now, a song of
wine and dancing and pretty maids and the chasing of said maids by
lusty young men on a midsummers' night a-glimmer with fireflies and
incandescent hearts! SING!”

“May I ask,” said Jovius, trying not to sound timid, “for whom I sing?”

“ASK!” commanded Mutton-Chop.

“Er...” said Jovius.

“I am Penny Bart, and this is Colonel Bart, a war hero.”

“Very proud to know you, miss and you, sir.”

“Madam,” said the girl, “for I am married.”

“What?” said Jovius, “Surely not!”

“I assure you, sir. I am proud to be Mrs. Bart. I am his and he is mine.”

“What, *him?*” asked Jovius, looking at the Colonel, who was plump as a plum,
and so it was hard to guess his age, but he had to have been at least sixty.

“Indeed, sir.  And now, sir, before you begin your next song, which we await
avidly, kindly return the favor.”

“I am none other than Jovius! Minstrel and story-teller.  Balladier, thief
of hearts, not of... not of... What's so funny?”

The masked man was smiling and laughing a silent laugh.  When Jovius questioned
him directly, he strode forwared on silent feet and looked Jovius in the eye.
The man's eyes were grey.  But their grey was not so much a color as a movement.
There was a swirling energy, a wild, insane motion, a twisting, storming cyclone
moving where it willed, destroying, wearing down, playing tricks, constant yet
ever-changing and ever-laughing.  The man's eyes made Jovius dizzy and frightened;
he felt as if his body had no more weight than a leaf and he felt the solidness
of the oak floor beneath his feet falling away.  The man smiled behind his mask
and said in the voice of the wind howling over distant hills: “You're not Jovius!”

The paintings vanished, the furniture vanished, the man and his juvenile wife vanished,
the clown in the pajamas vanished, the mask vanished, only the eyes remained and 
Jovius was falling.

Strong hands caught Jovius and strong hands lifted him back to his feet.  Strong
hands slapped his cheeks gently until Jovius realized that he was real again and
solid.  He was standing face-to-face not with the masked white clown, but with
a burly man with a busy mustache.  The man was holding him up by his shirt and
slapping his face.  Jovius brushed the slapping hand away and shook himself out
fo the lifting hand, both of which were duly withdrawn.  Jovius looked around
at where he was.  It was a room about the same size and shape as the room he
had been in.  It had once had a window in the same place, but the glass was
broken.  Spray painted words and pictures covered every wall in place of the
paintings.  The oak floor was scratched and, in places, scorched.  The only
light shown from a huge metal flashlight rolling freely on the ground and a little
from the deep magenta sky behind the blackened hills seen thought the window.

Jovius would never look himself in the mirror if he ever heard himself ask
“What's going on?” or “Where am I?” and so he bit his tongue.  The mustached
man said, instead “What's your name, son?”

Jovius thought of that wild-eyed man saying “You're not Jovius!” and responded—and
he was quite startled to discover how truthfully it was that he responded—“I
don't know.”
