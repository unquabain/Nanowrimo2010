# Chapter 2010-11-07 - 1

The forest was dense and dark.  It was hard to walk through.  Brambles snatched and tore
at her wonderful robe.  Sonja began to wonder if leaving the warm vinyard hadn't been a
mistake.

The taste of the wine was still on her lips, and the distant ache of a memory that wouldn't
materialize still worked at her heart.  She licked her lips and thought of someone she
couldn't name and couldn't picture.  A woman, that was all she knew.

She was travelling up-hill now, away from the cold creek.  The day was still warm and
the canopy of leaves, far from giving her a cooling shade, smothered her like a blanket.
She was finding it harder and harder to breathe.  And that, too, felt strangely familiar.
The thick, fragrant air of the forest choked her more and more and she began to sweat
in an un-ladylike manner.  Dark stains appeared on her silver gown at the armpits, down the
back and between her breasts.  Each step was harder than the last, and with it, the twin pains
in her lungs and her heart stabbed her more sharply.

Finally, she had to sit down on a fallen tree.  She wheezed loudly. She barked like a seal.
Tears fell from her eyes into her lap as she bent double with the effort of sucking in the
thick, molasses air of the forest.  Twice more, she barked like a seal and collapsed onto
the forest floor.  She clutched at the silver gown and tore it from her chest, ripping it
in two at the waist, but it didn't help.  The constriction was in her own skin.

“Your thirsty,” said a low voice above her.  It was a woman's voice, but deeper than any
man's voice, Sonja thought. It was dark in the forest, but a shadow moved over her none-the-less.
A powerfull musky smell surrounded her, so thick and tangible that it almost felt like silk
brushing against her face.

“You need to drink,” said the voice.  Sonja couldn't control her movements.  She writhed and
flopped on the pine-needle floor.  A cold, wet nose nudged her twice in the ribs.

“I'm hungry,” said the voice.  Sonja barked in reply.

“I can help you, or I can eat you,” she said.  “Give me something to eat and live, or 
give me something to eat and die.”

Sonja grabbed the little napkin bundle on her sash, but didn't have the strength to undo the
knot.  She felt great teeth and hot, wet breath on her hand, and she pulled her hand away
instinctively.  She felt the bundle ripped from her clothes.  The shadow moved away from her
for a while, and Sonja continued to gasp and flounder on her own.

After a time, the shadow and the musky smell came back.

“Grab my fur,” said the voice.  Sonja reached up and held a huge head.  She found two leathery
ears and clung to them, her grip only semi-voluntary.  The huge head raised up and Sonja clung
to those ears.  A huge muzzle pushed itself between her legs and lifted her.  She slid down
a furred neck, her face sliding through thick, bristling hair.  The musk smell was like the
smell of bourbon.  She barked again.

“Hold on to my fur,” said the female voice.  Not a woman's voice, realized Sonja.  A female
voice, but not a woman's.  The giant beast began to lumber back down the hill.

“You're a strange fish,” said the beast conversationally. “You have good cheese for a fish.
Very good cheese.”

Though every moment seemed an eternity to Sonja, they reached the bottom of the valley in
less time than she expected.  The beast stopped and shook.  Sonja lost her grip on the fur
and tumbled into the cold stream.

“There you are, fish.  Back in the water,” said the beast.

Water came in Sonja's nose and mouth as she continued to gasp.  She tried to get to her hands
but the giant muzzle came back and pushed her down into the water.  The cold made her hands
and feet numb.  She coughed and sputtered and barked.  She tried to lift her head, but something
large and leathery struck her head and pushed it under the water. A gush of cold water came in
through her nose.  She coughed harder. The huge leathery thing was still on her head and-God-it
was strong! She couldn't lift her head and more cold water rushed in.  She spasmed and coughed
and each time she did, more water rushed into her lungs from her mouth and nose.  Cold water.
It chilled her chest and made her head ache.

But the cold was soothing.  It numbed the pain in her chest.  It soothed the burning in her
throat.  Her spasming and coughing turned into steady, rhythmic sucking in cold water through
her nose and pushing it back out her mouth.  The rhythm and the cold were soothing.  In a brief
while, she realized that she was *breathing* the water.  She could feel it flow through her
nostrils, feel it thick and cold in her throat and chest.  It didn't move as quickly as air,
she had to breathe more slowly, more patiently, and that was calming, too.

Sonja opened her eyes and saw the bottom of the clear stream.  Moss waved on the rocks like
grass in a breeze and where a rock burst the mirrored, turbulent surface, jewel-bright bubbles
sparkled and danced.

Since she had stopped struggling, the leathery paw released her.  Perhaps the beast thought
she was now dead and was going to eat her.  Sonja was trying to figure out how to escape,
when she heard the voice again as if from a great distance.

“Silly fish.  Why do you fight the stream?”

Sonja rolled over and looked up.  Directly above her, she could see through the mirrored
surface of the water.  There was a huge beast standing over the stream.  She sat up a little,
breaking the water with her forehead and eyes, but keeping her nose below the stream.  The
beast was a tremendous golden bear as big as a van.

Sonja tried to say “I'm not a fish,” but she found her vocal chords didn't work the same way
with water in her lungs.

“Stay here,” said the bear, “until you feel better.  Then go back to your home on the hill.
Silly fish can walk around and pretend they aren't fish for a time, just as silly bears
can walk around and pretend they aren't bears.  But you gave me good cheese.”

The bear turned and lumbered off into the shadowy woods.  

Sonja tried to rise and run after the bear.  She didn't know why: to ask it questions? Because
it reminded her of someone? Because it had saved her?  But it didn't matter because she
couldn't move her legs.  She was naked to the waist, but the silver gown swirled around
her legs in the current and was tangled.  It as as if instead of two legs, she had but one
long silver appendage.  She tore at the gown with numbed fingers, but could not get a grip
on the slick fabric.  When she looked again, the bear was gone.

Sonja found that she could walk on her hands a little in the shallow stream, keeping her
eyes above the water and letting her body and useless legs float behind her.  She pulled
herself up stream to a spot where the afternoon sun was shining on the clear water.  It
was warmer there, though the water itself was still icy cold as it ran swiftly over her
skin.  She put her head under the water and folded her arms in front of her to use as
a pillow.  She rested her head and let the sun shine on her back.  In a moment, the water
began to taste slightly of salt, and Sonja reasoned that this was the only way she could
tell if she were crying.

So she fell asleep in the stream.
