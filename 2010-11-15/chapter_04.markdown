# Chapter 2010-11-15 - 4

The generator sputtered to life and bright blue arc lights sputtered
and blazed.  The short day was already winding down into twilight, but
Cold was having none of it.  He was going to shine a light into every
secret this old house had.  Open it wide.

None of his officers had questioned him when he had ordered them all to
the old mansion with every bit of gear they had.  They all trusted him,
but he could see in their eyes that they didn't understand.  Well, he
had a good deal of reputation as a thoroughly practical man to piss away
on this lunacy.

Officers went in and out of the mansion like ants into and out of a hive.
They went around the house, poking at the gardens.  Officer Henry had
volunteered his personal metal detector that he used to look for coins
at Canon Beach.

Light burst from the second story windows as the power connection was made.

Light burst from under the porch as that space was boldly invaded.  *Hell,*
thought Cold, *I didn't even dare to think that this spooky old place **had**
a cellar.*

Finally, lights bazed from the window in the attic.  The entire old house
was lit like a Jack-O-Lantern and just as hollow.

Cold took that as his cue to enter.  No shadows.  Nowhere for a ghost to hide
now.  Blast them away and scrub every corner with bold attention.  Clap in
every nook and ring bells behind every door.

“Sir!” said Officer Henry coming out from behind a door Cold had thought was
a closet, “I may have found something!”

Cold was actually surprised.  That was almost immediate.  He hadn't actually
expected to find anything, just to scrub this place from his mind.  He followed
Henry behind the door and found a flight of narrow stairs.  The stairwell itself
was still dark, and this annoyed Cold, but it opened out on a glaring furnace
of steady, comforting electric light.  Cold was in a perfectly ordinary-looking
cellar.  Also predictable for this old place, it didn't look as if it had been
inhabited by teenagers and tramps as the first floor had.  Henry led him round
a corner and then another.  Cold began to realize that there was a veritable maze
of passages below the house.  Storage areas, long emptied, racks for wine, for
books, for Christmas ornaments.  Now housing only dust and mice foeces.  They
arrived at last at the end of a maze.  A small room behind a small door.  A single
worklamp had been hung here, and Cold and Henry's shadows stretched long and black on the floor
and walls.

“Sir,” said Henry, pointing his flashlight at the floor.  Cold looked and, at first,
he saw nothing.  But then Henry said “No dust, sir.”

Sure enough, there was no dust on the floor of this room.  Firing up his own flashlight,
Cold was able to see a pattern of dust on the floor like a dry riverbed.  Aluvial drifts
formed streams radiating from this room into the hallway.  Henry brought out his pocket
knife and inserted the blade under the wall.  It slid easily into a groove between the
wall and the floor.

A false wall.

“What's beyond?” asked Cold.

“Don't know yet.  Haven't figured out how to open it yet.”  Henry thumped against the
wall, which looked like masonry but gave a hollow sound.

“Break it down,” said Cold.  He turned and walked out as Henry got on his radio.  By the
time Cold had returned to the first floor, officers and volunteers were already bringing
power tools and more extension cords into the house and down into the cellar.

Officer Mitchell brought him some hot—and typically terrible—coffee.  It bothered him that
she did this for everyone, but no one had asked her, so he took the coffee and savored the
comforting way it was somehow both burnt and pitifully weak.

“Mitchell,” he said after he had taken a few sips and let the coffee smell—always better than
the taste of coffee itself—fill his nostrils.

“Yeah, Cold?”

Cold made a noise and turned away.

There was a crunch and a crash from below, and Cold imagined he felt the floor begin to sag a
little more.  In a minute, Officer Henry emerged from the corridor.

“We're opening the chamber now,” he said.

Cold followed Henry back into the cellar once again.  It was easier to follow the Labyrinth of
corridors now with the Orange Extension Cables of Theseus leading him to whatever Minotaur
lay behind that wall.

The room at the end was crowded with people.  Volunteers, friends and family had come out to
help.  People he hadn't seen since the police department picnic were wielding circular saws
and drills.  Where had these people come from?

They parted as Cold arrived, ducking out of the way, deferring to his authority.  Who the Hell
did they think he was, Geraldo Rivera?

Officer McDonald and Pinter the Hardware Store Guy were removing a neat rectangle of masonry
that they had sawn through which and turned out to be cleverly sculpted plaster mounted on a wooden
plank backing.  Cold pulled out his massive flashlight and went through the hole into the darkness
beyond.  He shone the flashlight at the ceiling rather than pointing it around the room, and it
gave off a soft, even light with no shadows, and that pleased Cold.

Cold had stepped into a small study.  A look behind him revealed the clever mechanism that no
doubt opened the concealed door non-destructively.  There was a desk and several masonry
jars with white labels.  There was a journal on the desk lying open.

“This Colonel Bart's office?” asked Officer Henry, peeking his head through the hole.

Cold made a noise.  Then he flipped the journal closed and opened the leather cover to glance
at the yellow front-paper.

“Moleskin,” he said, “kind they sell at the new Barnes & Noble on Beech down by the Outback
Steakhouse.”

Then Cold began to flip through the pages of the journal.  The handwriting certainly looked
like it could have belonged to Colonel Bart.  It was the kind of extravagant caligraphy they
always had in the old movies.  It was hard for Cold to read in the dim light, but he caught
a few words.  ‘Mercury,’ was one.  Alchemy?  Someone trying to turn lead into gold down here?

“Find out what's in those jars,” Cold ordered, setting the book down on the desk.  “Also,” he
added, then stopped.  He turned around and glanced at the desk again, then searched the room
uncertainly.  Then he stepped back through the hole.  Officer Henry stood eagerly on the
other side.  “Find the pen,” said Cold.
