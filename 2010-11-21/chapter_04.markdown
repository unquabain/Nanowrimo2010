Penny watched the man in the cemetery from the high window on the high hill.
Another one scratching at the boundaries between worlds?  Why so many?  Who
were they trying to rescue?

Then Penny looked up at the stars behind the thick clouds.  So far away, now.
How very far away the looked.  The Colonel didn't like her looking at the 
stars.  He didn't like her looking at the people out there either.  She must

side of the veil, the more she felt that there must be more than singing.
There must be other songs to sing.  There must be other keys and other melodies.
There must be other stories out there, in the rain, in the dark.
