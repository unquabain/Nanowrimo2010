# Chapter 2010-11-21 - 3

Demos felt stupid. This was stupid. These words, they didn't mean
anything. They were meant to sound mystic, but they weren't. They were
nonsense. They probably sounded mystic to the American who had written
them down, but Demos recognized a jumbled up old Greek nursery rhyme in
the words. Just some nonsense about the wind. Might as well be singing
“Rock-a-bye baby.” When the wind blows, the cradle will rock and
down will come…

…Well maybe that was a bad example.

This was stupid. He was cold, it was dark, this was impossible. Black
magic indeed. Demos didn't even believe in that crap.

Still. Mixing up some gross stuff, singing a little song, staying up
late—not that he would be sleeping anyway—if he could see Sonja
again… well, what's a little silliness?

Most of the ingredients the man had written down for him were easy to
obtain. The fingerbone, however, was a little troubling. Thanks to
his encounter with the musical tramp, however, he now had some useful
pointers for avoiding the cemetery undertaker.

Security had been stepped up a bit since they had almost been caught and
since the murders had started coming to light. But still, the caretaker
and his friend had several acres of obstacle-filled ground to check in
the few hours of dusk that this season in this latitude afforded them.
It was easy for Demos to avoid them while they satisfied themselves that
the cemetery was empty.

Earlier that day, Demos had spotted a small service and knew that the
earth there would still be soft. Hopefully, if he did his job well
enough, no one would notice in the morning that the disturbed earth had
been disturbed too many times.

Finding his way back to the site in the dark was harder than Demos
anticipated. It was another overcast night, and the only light came from
the main shopping strip reflected off the low clouds. The statues seemed
to come alive in the greenish light of the fluorescents and vapor lamps.
One winged figure brandishing a stone sword in particular seemed to turn
and follow him as he passed it.

Demos had heard stories about statues in cemeteries having eyes so deep
in dark that you couldn't see into them in broad daylight and were said
to drive people who gazed too deeply mad. He wondered what happened at
night when those shadows bled out into the surrounding darkness. In
fact, Demos was unable to keep such stories out of his mind at all, so
he tried to focus on the more unlikely stories. It was said that in one
cemetery in Chicago, Marshall Field would get up and walk down the hall
of their grand shared mausoleum to harass the specter of Richard W.
Sears. Or vice versa. Whatever.

At last, he found the plot and the dark stain of newly churned earth.
He carefully set down his bag and pulled out the shovel. He unwrapped
the head from the velvet cloth. He walked to the foot of the grave and
leaned on his shovel. Now… just dig.

He picked up the shovel and was about to plunge it into the earth, but
then he thought about the body lying under all that cold soil. The
thought of it looking up through the gaps in the loosely packed earth
at him standing there. He thought of the people he had seen around the
grave at the service. Their silent faces. Comforting shoulder hugs.
Discrete handkerchiefs.

As a boy, he had seen an extravagant funeral of a rich man from his
village. He had provided for women to be hired to wail and tear their
clothes in the old fashioned way. He had heard that in New Orleans,
people played raucus Jazz music and danced at funerals. Here, they just
stood in the rain and pretended they felt nothing. You had to pretend
something, he supposed. Even if you exaggerated your own emotions, you
had to play act or else you'd start to feel them. Demos had come face to
face with how dangerous that could be. He could feel the daemon of his
own emotions scratching at the back of the mask he wore.

He thought of the silent people among the silent statues watching their
loved one—he didn't even know if it was a man or a woman—disappear
into the embrace of the first mother. They must each have had a daemon
of their own scratching at all those porcelain masks they wore. White
masks and black robes.

A shiver ran up his spine. He was a ghoul. He was standing in a
graveyard in the middle of night with a shovel. It was one thing to talk
metaphorically about daemons, but he was now a ghoul. Literally a ghoul.

He thrust the head of the shovel into the dirt and heard the soft “shuff”
noise. The sound of a shovel in dirt.  It struck him in the heart just
as if the shovel itself had been thrust there.  He leaned on the shovel
to press it into the dirt and felt the blade push further into his own
chest.

It started to rain harder.  Miniature puddles filled in the divets and
crags in the mound of dirt.

Demos sank to his knees and leaned on the shovel and the rain collected
in his curly hair and streamed down his face.  It pooled in his eyes
and blurred his vision and streamed down his cheeks.
